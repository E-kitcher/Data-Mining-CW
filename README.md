# Data-Mining-CW
## Aim: 
Find the groups/connections of various books about Antiquity (both classical and secondary literature).

## Project description: 
Investigate 24 Antiquity documents, which have been scanned into HTML format, with the aim of exploring/discovering how they relate to one another. We did this through a series of pre-processing steps and initial investigation of the data using K-Means. We then refine our data with LSA and use continue to explore the data with K-means, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering. 

The code can be found in the ipynb file.
