PREFACE.



ThE text of this edition follows, for the most part, Oielli's,Zurich, , which, being based on a new and most faithfulrecension of the Medicean MS. by his friend Baiter, may just­ly be considered as marking a new era in the history of thetext of Tacitus. In several passages, however, where he hasneedlessly departed from the MS.,.I have not hesitated to ad­here to it in company with other editors, believing, that notunfrequently "the most corrected copies are the least correct."The various readings have been carefully compared through­out, and, if important, are referred to in the notes.



The editions which have been most consulted, whether inthe criticism of the text or in the preparation of the notes,are, besides Orelli's, those of Walther, Halle, ; Ruperti,Hanover, ; and Dbderlein, Halle, . The notes ofOrelli are judicious and tasteful. Walther is sagacious, shrewdand independent, sometimes to a fault. Ruperti's edition ischiefly valuable as a repository of facts and opinions, selectedwith no great care and put together with little skill. Doder-lein is concise and discriminating, but is excessively fond oforiginality and bold conjecture. His Essay on the Style ofTacitus, besides this fault in the matter, is also wanting inease and elegance of language; yet it has been esteemedworthy to be translated for this edition, as on the whole oneof the best treatises on that subject. Botticher's LexiconTaciteum, Berlin, , is marked by a felicitous expression,as well as a just appreciation, of our author's merits as a his­

torian and of his peculiarities as a writer; and its most valu­able results have been freely incorporated with the notes.Freund's Worterbuch der Lateinischen Sprache, and Smith'sDictionaries, of Greek and Roman Antiquities, and of Biog­raphy and Mythology, the former republished in this countryunder the supervision of Dr. Anthon, and the latter stillissuing in numbers from a London press, ha^p been foundvery useful, and are often referred to. References are alsomade to Becker's Gallus, and to the Roman Histories ofNiebuhr, Arnold and Schmitz.



It 'will be seen, that there are not unfrequent references tomy edition of the Germania and Agricola. These are not ofsuch a nature, as to render this incomplete without that, oressentially dependent upon it. Still, if both editions are used,it will be found advantageous to read the Germania andAgricola first. The Treatises were written in that order, andin that order they best illustrate the history of the author'smind. The editor has found in his experience as a teacher,that students generally read them in that way with more fa­cility and pleasure, and he has constructed his notes accord­ingly.



The notes on the Histories have been prepared with thesame general views and principles, as those on the Germaniaand Agricola. In accordance with suggestions in some ofthe public journals, they have been made somewhat moregrammatical. Their value in this respect has been enhancedby more copious references to the excellent grammar ofZumpt in addition to that of Andrews and Stoddard. It ischiefly by way of such references, that the general principlesof grammar have been illustrated. Sometimes, however, aconcise statement of the principle referred to has been added;and in regard to such idioms and constructions as are moreor less peculiar to ,Tacitus, it has been found necessary toenter into more extended comments. It is hoped, that thenotes will be found to contain not only the grammatical, but

likewise all the geographical, archaeological and historical il­lustrations, that are necessary to render the author intelligi­ble. The editor has at least endeavored to avoid the fault,which Lord Bacon says " is over usual in annotations andcommentaries, viz. to blanch the obscure places, and discourseupon the plain." But it has been his constant, not to say hischief aim, to- carry students beyond the dry details ofgrammar and lexicography, and introduce them into a famil­iar acquaintance and lively sympathy with the author and histimes, and with that great empire, of whose degeneracy anddecline,in its beginnings,he has bequeathed to us so profoundand instructive a history. It was for this end, that the Pre­liminary Remarks were composed ; and if they accomplishthis result in any considerable degree,, though long, they willhardly be thought too long, and they will not have beenwritten in vain.



The Indexes have been prepared with much labor andcare, and, it is believed, will add materially to the value ofthe work.



The editor takes this opportunity to express his gratefulsense of the kind reception which has been given to his edi­tion of the Germania and Agricola, and his thanks especiallyfor such notices, whether by letter or in the public journals,as, while they fully appreciate its merits, point out its faultsfor correction. If this edition is in any degree more merito­rious or less faulty, the superiority will be owing, in no smallmeasure, to such acts of kindness. Besides his obligations tothose who have thus favored him, he acknowledges his par­ticular indebtedness to Professor B. B. Edwards of Andover,and Professor H. B. Hackett of Newton, for the aid and en­couragement, which they have in various ways extended tohim. He has been aided in the correction of the press byMr. Marshall Henshaw, whose accurate and patient scholar­ship well fit him to render such and still higher services toclassical learning.

With these explanations, the editor takes leave of a work,on which he has bestowed much time and toil, and which, hewould fain hope, may contribute in some humble measure tothe better understanding and appreciation by his youthfulcountrymen of an author, a language and a people, formedby nature beyond most, if not beyond all others, to be sever­ally the writer, the vehicle and the subject of history.

PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION.



IN this Kevised Edition, the text and the notes have beencarefully collated with those of Ritter in his new edition (Bonnand Cambridge, ), and such corrections and additions, aswere deemed just and important, have been adopted from thissource. I cannot, however, by any means, accept the manygratuitous emendations and dogmatic assertions which disfig­ure and depreciate this otherwise excellent commentary. Othercorrections and improvements have also been made, whichhave been suggested by use of the book in classes, or to whichmy attention has been called, whether by private correspond­ence, or by notices and reviews in the public journals. I havebeen especially indebted to the critical acumen and accuratescholarship of my friend, Mr. Charles Short, of Roxbury, wri­ting in the Bibliotheca Sacra, for not a few valuable suggesÂ«tions and amendments.

ESSAY



ON THE STYLE OF TACITUS.*



. TaciTus was the inventor of an entirely new sty.fe of historiccomposition; or rather he did not himself designedly form it, but,while he applied himself to writing history -with a different designand spirit from other authors, a new style of expression was thenatural and necessary result. For formerly it had been a prevalentcustom among writers of history, not only to defer writing till theyhad arrived at a mature age, but also to compose with calm and tran­quil feelings; differing in this respect from orators, who were wontto believe that the effect of their speaking would correspond with thedegree of energy and emotion with which they spoke. Hence thecalm, smooth and flowing style of the ancient historians, even ofthose who desired to be distinguished from the others by a sort ofpeculiar dignity.



Now Tacitus was the first to depart from the rules of these wri­ters. For it was the natural bont of his genius, not so much to nar­rate the mere facts and events of history, which are often fortuitous,but he labored especially to exhibit the character and spirit of theactors in his scenes. Hence his chief merit, his great power, is seenin the delineation of character : whether he labors by description toplace before us the image of some distinguished man; or so relateshis deeds, that the reader, by his own discernment, forms an opinionof his secret motives and principles of action.



But since constant reflection upon virtue or vice has a very greatinfluence over the passions, he came to write in an excited ratherthan a tranquil state of mind, so that he seems to possess more of theardor of youth than of the maturity of age. Now of such a state ofmind, a rapid and energetic style is the natural expression and thenecessary result. In a word, his style is impetuous, always hasten­ing on to the issue, impatient of delay. And this arose not merely

from his own natural disposition, but he adapted the style of his nar­rative to the taste of his age. For, as is usually the case in a timeof great moral declension, not only lassitude and listlessness, butalso, at the same time, a sort of morbid desire for haste, had takenpossession of the spirits of men; while those qualities which are aproper mean between themâ€”calmness of spirit and a healthy activityâ€”are the characteristic of but few. Hence what was formerly con­sidered simplicity and dignified repose, then began to appear dull,spiritless and insipid. Tacitus was therefore impelled at the sametime by his own genius, and by the taste of his age, to a hurried styleof expression.



But rapidity is opposed to dignity,â€”a grace which cannot be sepa­rated from equability and moderation. And since dignity, in ancienttimes, was the peculiar characteristic and requisite of a good history,so skill was necessary in the later historians to temper rapidity withdignity. To accomplish this purpose, Tacitus employed the utmostdiligence in producing an ornamented diction.



Now since I must briefly treat of the style of Tacitus, I will firstshow by what arts, nay, even by what artifices, he attained to thatbrevity which we admire as appropriate and peculiar to this writer;secondly, by what means he made his style at the same time dignifiedand beautiful.*



. The conciseness of Tacitus is proverbial. But an incorrectnotion has prevailed among some, viz. that this consists mostly in thebrevity of single expressions, such as resemble the responses oforacles. And this style of writing does indeed prevail in the treatiseon Germany, inasmuch as it is best adapted to description; and whileJohn Mueller and others, who seek a reputation for the same, imitateit, they think they are rivalling Tacitus. But, on the contrary, theacute judgment and the consummate skill of this writer are seen in thisvery thing, that he adopted this style, so rare, only in treating thosesubjects, the nature of which demanded it, while in other connectionshe is scarcely less fond of full and rounded periods, not being inferior,in this respect, to Cicero and Livy. At the commencement of theAnnals, he hastens, in a series of very brief propositions, to premisewhatever was important, from which he passes to a very full andbrilliant period, and thus introduces the history itself, as if he wouldshow the difference between the preface and the real history, by asudden change of diction. The orations, inserted in the narrative,consist, according to the character of the speaker, sometimes of con-

cise sentences, sometimes of rounded periods. And in the narrationof heroic deeds, battles and debates, he varies his style, according ashe himself hastens on to more important matters, or desires to urgeand hurry forward the minds of his readers, or to delay them andpersuade them to a calmer examination of the subject. Therefore henever wearies us by a series of concise sentences, continued beyondproper limits, which is a fault of Seneca.



Tacitus has omitted nothing which would contribute to brevity oistyle. In this he chose to imitate, not so much the oracles, as theancient Roman writers. For as the language < f the Greeks wasnaturally adapted to express grace (x<fp,ra), so that of the Romanscontained in it the elements of dignity, and, as it were, imperialbrevity. In its own nature it was fitted to illustrate that com­mon saying: quot verba, tot pondera. I might mention the wantof the articleâ€”a thing to be regretted in other respectsâ€”as amongthe chief reasons and sources of this merit, although this is not theplace for examining this subject more fully. Now Cicero, and thewriters of his time, disregarded, in a manner, this natural characterof the Latin tongue, while they attempted to soften the rough powerand strength of the Roman language by the polish and refinement oithe Greek. But those writers who adorned the age of the Cssarsafter the time of Tiberiusâ€”Seneca and Tacitusâ€”again departed fromthis elegance of style. For they carefully and intelligently cherishedthat style of expression, which the ancient Romans, almost withoutcultivation and under the impulse of their nature, had employed.Besides other advantages, they labored to preserve, the power of theancient style, in such a way as both to avoid the antique rudeness ofan uncultivated age, and drop the effeminate verbosity of a subse­quent period.



While therefore Tacitus strove to speak so that every word mighthave its weight, he made use of many, or rather of all kinds of in­genious contrivances, not neglecting even the most minute. Nor,while I am pursuing this subject, do I entertain any fear of seemingto depreciate the ability of Tacitus, as if it were the mark of a weakand narrow mind, in so earnest a narration of the most importantevents, to choose his words with a sort of scholarlike care and anxi­ety. The foundation and source of so rich a diction was the sublimegenius of Tacitus, the greatness of his mind, and the strength andfervor of his emotions. At the same time, it is well known withwhat almost religious scrupulosity the ancients elaborated, each one forhimself, their style and language; and, in so doing, attributed less toa sort of divine power and inspiration, (as if words would flow from asubject spontaneously,) than to industry and care. Remarkable sto

ries are told even about Thucydides, of such a carefu, choice respecfring substantives and infinitives; but Tacitus lived at an age whichwas much richer in the rules of grammar and rhetoric, and, as wasnatural for a Roman, he strove more earnestly than the Greeks torender his style as effective as possible. Wherefore to that hurriedbreviloquence, to which he was led by the impulses of his nature, hesuperadded all the ornaments of learning, art and taste, not fearingthe appearance or the reproach of a labored brevity, but freely reject­ing the merit of a plain, pure and natural style. Now this brevity isseen in choosing the shortest words which will express the thoughts,in omitting as many words as possible, and finally in condensing thesentences themselves within the smallest possible compass.



. To commence with the smallest matters, he generally prefers theshorter forms of words to the longer, sometimes contrary to commonusage. Few, I think, use simple ut for velut, as if, as he does inAnn. II., ; HI., ; or for front, Ann. I., ; Hist. II., : quafor quatenus, since, even at the hazard of obscurity, Ann. VI., ;XL,  ; XV., ; Hist. II., : super for insuper, Hist. II., . Forthe same reason he often used ne, where the common rule requiredut non, e. g., Ann. II., . Ita moderans ne lenire neve asperarecrimina viderelur, Add. XL, ,  ; XII.,  ; XVI.,  ; Hist. EI.,. If we can put confidence in the MSS. he also often used quefor quoque. See in Ann. IV., ; VI., ; XII., .



Tacitus often manifests a sort of dislike for substantives ending infto; for besides their length they are somewhat barren of meanincHe therefore prefers aemulalus, dispositus, advectus, and such likewords, to aemulatio, and those of a similar form. Hence I havedefended diversus in Ann. XIII., ; and pulsus in Hist. IV., , asthe true reading. Elsewhere he is wont also to employ the primitivenoun in place of the derivative, as in Ann. VI., , Dial. , fdbulaefor confabulaliones; G. , fenus fovfeneratw; Hist. II., , audew-tioribus spatiis for spatiationiius. And since the use of deponentverbs had long prevailed, by which means the language was virtuallyrobbed of an equal number of passive verbs and thereby impoverished,Tacitus did not hesitate to return to the ancient signification of suchwords, and to use passives that were obsolete in his age, gaining theadvantage of brevity, and, at the same time, the appearance of an­tiquity. Hence adipisci is used passively in Ann. XV.,  ; opperiri,Ann. XI.,' ; ulcisci, Ann. I.,  ; and palari, Hist. III., ; perhapsalso fateri, Dial. .



. The use of simple words ii stead of compound is very extensive,In which Tacitus vies with poets. The principle of this license isno other than to substitute the genus for the species ; for instance,

quaerere instead of acquirere, Ann. I., ; instead of conquirere,Ann. VI., ; instead of exquirere, Ann. II., ; instead otrequirere= desiderate, Hist. IV., . Hence this exchange is usually madewith a loss of definiteness, but with advantage in regard to brevity.I will mention a few examples, unique indeed, but yet allowed byall. Hist. I., , congestu lapidum stare = constare.â€”Ann. XIV., ,struere = destrttere.â€”Ann. XV., , cernerent = decernerent.â€”G., ,tristem cullu = ad incolendum.â€”Ann. XIV., , pectori haerens =irihaerens.â€”Hist. ILL, , miscebant = immiscebani.â€”Hist. HI., ,pulsos = impulsos.â€”Hist. I., , sistens = obsistens.â€”Ann. XV.,, cepisse = suscepisse. In many other places I have restored thisusage from the MSS., where other editors have not ventured to doso: e. g., Agr. , Sublime el rectum ingenium, i. e., erectum.â€”Hist.IV., , Omnibus porlis rumpunt, where the common editions haveerumpunt.â€”Hist. IV., , Postremo aestimari a medicis jubet, whereErnesti has preferred existimari.â€”Hist. IV., , Si pauca suprapetiero ab initio, Edd. repetiero. Perhaps also cursaturus should bepreferred to incursaturus in A. .



. The dignity of the Latin language is impaired by nothing morethan by a frequent use of particles, pronouns, or auxiliary verbs; onthe other hand it is increased when nouns follow nouns or verbs di­rectly, so that the sentence seems to consist of mere solid and weightymatter. Thus originate those sentences which strike our ears, andthose of the Greeks, as too cumbrous and heavy, since there is nopause allowed after the separate parts and words. But the sameexpressions had a very pleasing sound to the Romans, and especiallyto Tacitus, as the following: Agrippina aequi impatiens, dominandiavida, virilibus curis feminarum vitia exuerat, Ann. VI., . In thisexample, whatever is heavy was produced spontaneously withoutany design or study. But weight and stateliness may be promotedby an intentional effort of the writer. With this view Tacitus omitsthe more unimportant words oftener, and with more studious design,than any other -writer. And first he refrains from the use of prepo­sitions, satisfied with the power of the case alone. Hence ab or exis omitted contrary to common usage. Hist. V., , Commeatus Galliaadventantes, cf. III., .â€”Agr. , Cujus possessions revocatum.â€”G. , Exigunt principis sui libhralitate illum bellatorem equum.â€”Hist. I., , Non tamen quisquam in modumconcionis aut suggestulocutus.â€”III., , Cum superjacta tela tesludine laberentur.



Hence I have restored the shorter reading of the manuscripts inAgr.  : Ut civitates proximis hibernis in remota et avia deferren!,and Hist. HI., : Clamore proximis orto. In both places the editionshave a proximis.



 ESSAY ON THE



In the same way the dative is very often used for the ablative withab, e. g., Hist. III.,  : Ne tnilitibus inter-ficeretur. Moreover, inia omitted, e. g., Hist. V., : Vilisque aurea temph reperta. Hist. I.,: Hi discordes et rebus minoribus sibi quisque tendentes.



Hence I have erased in of the common editions as often as it iswanting in the, MSS. Hist. II., : Imperia ducum ineerto reliquerat.Hist. I., : Ipsi (in) medio vagi, as Ann. II., . Hist. II.,  :Appulsu litoris trucidatus.



Moreover, ad or in is used or omitted promiscuously before the ac­cusative. I pass by those examples in which a preposition entersinto the composition of the verb, as, advolvi genua; although evensuch have given offence, as Hist. III., , Stoecliadas insulas ajfertur ;and c. , Omniaque quae agenda forent... aderat; for in both theseplaces the old editions inserted ad. Very often the early editors si­lently inserted a preposition, which, upon the authority of the manu­scripts, I have either erased, or advised to erase, or ought myself tohave erased. Hist. III., : (in) majus accipiiur, Agr. : (in)universum aestimanti. The following are more peculiar to Tacitus :Hist. I., : Marium Celsum . . . (ad) supplkium expostulabant.Hist. II.,  : Macer (ad) exitium poscebatur.



I suspect that I shall hardly persuade many that Tacitus makesuse of this license ; but, at all events, it was worth while to set fortha number of examples, and the unanimity of the MSS. And surelyit would be wonderful harmony between books, if the same errorwere so often repeated. Each one, according to his own taste, willconcede to Tacitus more or less of this liberty of accomplishing, bythe power of the cases alone, most purposes for which other writersthink prepositions necessary. I only add, Hist. II.,  : Ne periculoprineipis famam clementiae affectaret; cf. IV., . Hist. II.,  :Vulgus clamore el gaudio deflectere via.



. The use of the genitive is likewise somewhat more extensivewith Tacitus than with other Latin authors, since, by its assistancehe could dispense with prepositions. What other writer has usedjus Wbertorum, Hist. II., , oralis militum, Ann. XI., , for in lib-ertos, in milites ?



Tacitus seeks the same brevity in the use of the dative, which heis wont to substitute, with far greater freedom than other writers, forthe preposition ad, with the accusative. He says, in the same sense,Ann. II., , Neu proceres . . . ad discordias traherel, and Agr. ,Per principes factionibus et sludiis trdhuntur; or, Hist. II., , Inlacrimas effusus, and I., , lacrimis effusus; or, Hist. IV., , Uifirmior adversus fortuita, and, A. &,firmus advERsis. With charac­teristic love of variety he has brought together both constructions in



STXXE OF TACITUS. 



Ann. XIV., , Adversa pravitaii ipsius,prospera ad fortunamreferebat.



I will add some instances in which the more unwonted use of thedative has, from its unfrequency, escaped the notice of commenta­tors, or may, from its resemblance to the ablative, escape the noticeof the reader; Hist. I., , Pads adversa reipublicae pertinuere;G., , Propriis nationibus discreii; as, Hist. IV., , Propriis cu-neis componit; Hist. I., , Sacerdoiiis recoluit, i. e., in sacerdotia res-tiiuU; Hist. I., . , Sacramento adigere. Moreover, he uses thedative for adversus, with the accusative; A. , famae defendit, i. e.,adversus famam. On the contrary, he sometimes prefers a preposi­tion to the ordinary dative, when it will serve his purpose; Ann. II.,, Forma haud dissimili in dominum erat; and he substitutes invulgus for the dative vulgo, see in Hist. I., .



. He is no less sparing in the use of coryunciims, and is peculiarlyfond of asyndeta. The style of the Latins differs very much in the useof asyndeta from that of the Greeks. For since the Greeks make useof very many exceedingly small conjunctions, and such as often do noteven form a syllable, as in elision U and rl, they were not accustom­ed, merely for the sake of brevity or convenience, to omit conjunc­tions, but they omit them as often as it will subserve the purposes ofrhetoric. It is different with the Latins; since their conjunctionshave a fuller soun&and, in their length, equal many nouns andverbs, as aulem, qwalem, igitur, it was worth while, for the sakeof rapidity and conciseness, to be sparing in the use of them. Thencethe books of the Latins abound in asyndeta, even where they haveno peculiar significance or rhetorical power. Owing to the unprece­dented frequency with which he uses this liberty, the style of Tacitusis considered, for the most part, concise, and similar to that which theFrench call style coupe. For its character is seen, not only in its y/refraining from the longer forms of propositions, but also in its gen­erally omitting connectives between the separate propositions.



The peculiarity of Tacitus is seen in his frequent omission of thetwo conjunctions et and sed. Most Latin writers omit the copulative etas often as, by the rhetorical figure asyndeton, three or more separateparts of a sentence are connected together, since they dislike to use -many conjunctions in the same sentence. But Tacitus joins twomembers in the same way, in accordance with a custom of the an­cient Romans, which Niebuhr has noticed.* Examples are too nu­merous to require specification. Moreover, it is customary with'Tacitus to omit sed, especially after negative propositions. Ann. IV;,

 ESSAY ON THE



, Non modo libertas, etiam libido impunita ; Add. III., ; XVI.,; Hist. II., . Hence, without reason, Lipsius has urged the in­sertion of sed in Dial. . Nec hoc Mis alterius ter mille sestertiumpraestat; ipsa eloquentia, evidently like Agr. . Some MSS. alsoomit sec? in G. , Non solum apud plebem sed apud proceres, apudsacerdotes.



Of relative conjunctions ut is sometimes omitted by asyndeton, andnot by ellipsis. For, in Ann. III., , Petitum est, cognitionem re-ciperet, is not properly an ellipsis. And the same construction is'found in many other passages.



. At this day, indeed, when the science of grammar has begun tobe so much improved, no one will call such examples ellipses. now pass to ellipses proper.



Tacitus omits auxiliary verbs almost without any distinction oftense or mode. A. , Ac velut pacti; ibid. , ni incursaturus, sciJessem. Add. Hist. II.,  ; Hist. II., , quod inchoaturi, scil. surd,where the editions have inchoatur. The following may justly beconsidered somewhat harsh; Hist. IV., , Satis Marcello (sit) quodNerdnem in exitium tot innocentium impulerit. Hist. IV., , So-cius (esse) jactabat.



He is also accustomed to omit many other words, and the moregeneral the signification of each, the more frequently it is omitted, aswords of doing. Hist. L, , Omnia servilitor pro dominatione.Thus must be explained without correction, .Sgr. , At Brittanninon virtute sed occasione et arte ducis (factum esse) rati; coll. Hist.II., . Numberless ellipses of this kind might be mentioned ofwords of speaking, thinking, fearing, and going, not entirely pecu­liar to Tacitus, since Cicero also has a similar usage, e. g., N. D. II.,, Augures rem ad senatum, (tulerunt) ; senatus ut abdicarent con-sules (decrevit) ; abdicarunt. There are many more in his lettersto Atticus which exhibit even some appearance of haste. Where­fore, I do not understand why any one should wish to change, A. ,Nullam ultra potestatis personam, scil. agebat. Much less hasErnesti rightly forced agere into c. , Nihil per libertos servosquepublicae rei.



I pass by other common ellipses, as, of causa and potius. Onethat is rare has escaped the notice of commentators, in Hist. III., ,Et ut proditionis (scil. reum) ira militum in Flavianum incubuit.



. Brachylogy (Ppaxv^oyta) resembles ellipsis very closely. In el­lipsis, words must be supplied evidently from some external source ;these which are omitted through brachylogy are implied in the ad­joining words, and must be supplied from what either precedes orfollows. Of this figure there are three kinds. The first is when the

same word, that has been once expressed, must be understood again;as, Hist. III., , Simulationem prorsus et imaginem deponendi im­perii (scil. imaginem, speciem) fuisse; G. , Ne (scil. maritum)tanquam maritum, sed tanquam matrimonium ament. See in Hist.IV.,  ; Agr. . Also words must often be understood again aftera longer distance, though the obvious meaning of the sentencerequires the repetition. Hist. II., . Moles perfringendis (scil.piuteis et vineis,) obruendisque hostibus expediunt, unless for thesake of concinnity, opeAbus must be supplied. Hist. V., , Praeci-puum montium Libanon erigit, scil. Judaea ; A. , Dispecta est etThule, quam hactenus, scil. invenit domuitque.



Another kind of brachylogy when, in some word, a similar word,springing from the same root, is implied, so that one case must besupplied from another, one mode from another, a verb from a noun,and vice versa, and in fine, homogenebus words from homogeneous,for the purpose of completing the sense.

There is a species of the same zeugma in that custom, surprising toour ears, and scarcely imitable in our language, of uniting the sampverb or word in one sense with one, and in another sense with anotherpart of the sentence. Pindar took the lead in this : IXtv i' ohop&ovSlav TapBlvov rt avvcwar, he slew CEnomaus and (married) the virgin;and in like manner Soph. Trach., . Like this is Hist. I., *,Plus sanguinis ac praedae Caecina hausit; Hist. II., , Britan-nicum militem hoste et mari distineri; Agr. , Silvarum et mon-tium profunda; Agr. , Nos Maurici Rusticique vuus, nos inno-centi sanguine Senecio perfudit.



. Another means of conciseness is that grammatical figurewhich we, at this day, are beginning to call prccgnantiaâ€”a wordquite recently formed and a barbarous substantiveâ€”but yet appro­priate, and withal necessary, which the more strict, if they choose,may call structura praegnans. Very often a secondary idea liesconcealed in some noun or verb, unseen indeed, but breathing likethe foetus in the womb, and frequently also very forcible. I couldwish that some one of the great grammarians had defined, in an ap­propriate treatise, the compass and limits of this figure, that I mighthave some authority to follow; but now each, according to his ownhumor, is accustomed to use a vague and â– fcfined word ; a privi­lege which I shall claim for myself. BoUTnouns and verbs, andlikewise adverbs, are employed prcegnanter. Thus he says cupidofor pecuniae cupido, in Ann. XII., ; Hist. I., ; and on the otherhandpecunia in the same sense, Hist. III., . The following comeunder the same class, Hist. I., , Occulto habitu, scil. animi; for itought not to be understood of the assumption of a false dress; Hist.., , Cumulos, scil. corporum; Hist. IV., , Modesliae imagine inaltitudinem (silentii) conditus; Hist. IV., , Stare integram sedem,scil. belli; Dial. , Publico, scil. judicio; Ingenium = commentumingenii, in Hist. HI., ; Gaudio fungi = gaudii signification orgratulalione, Hist. II., ; Reposcentibus prospera, i. e., prosperorumrationem, Hist. III.,  ; Qui naves, qui classem, qui mare expecta-bant, Agr. , i. e., aggressionem per mare apertum ac non perfretum. In like manner with these words: Hist. I., , mansit, scil.in fide; A'gr. , perfudit, scil. horrore; Agr. , complecti, scil.bello, as, Hist. I., , Agr. , praesumpscre, scil. spe.



Frequently also adverbs or ablatives, datives or accusatives usedike adverbs, bear some attributive, either adjective or participle, as itwere, concealed in them. This is evidently contrary to Cicero's



STYLE OF TACITUS. )



custom, who preferred to call his work libri de officiis scripti, ratherthan to omit the participle. Now Tacitus, for the sake of rapidity inhis narrative, left such words to be supplied by the reader, as oftenas he thought there could be no danger of mistake: Hist. L, ,Longinum exarmant, quia non ordine mililiae (superior) sed e Galbaeamicis . . . erat; Hist. IH., , Vitelliani sola desperations (adjuti)ruebant; Hist. IV., , Plurimi Ditem patrem insignibus, quae inipso manifesta aut per ambages (significata) conjectant; Hist. V., ,Judaei mente sola (visibile) unumque numen inielligunt; Hist. I., ,Pessimus quisque in occasionem praedae, scil. intentus; Agr. ,Spent in nostris manibus (positum) habebant; Hist. HI. , Exerd-ius immane quantum (aucto) animo exitium valentis ut finem belliaecepii; Hist. I., , Pietas vestra acrius quam considerate (demon-strata) excitavit.



A few of these examples have escaped the notice of commenta­tors ; others, through a forgetfulness of this license, have been in­correctly understood: Agr. , Electus quem contubernio (dignum)existimaret; Hist. IH., , Defossa eruere, faces in manibus(gerentes), like the English " torch in hand." Nor ought the fol­lowing to be thought harsh, Hist. I., , Alexandriam praemissos at-que inde rursus (revocatos) refovebat.



Frequent also is that kind of pragnantia to which I may ventureto give the name structura contracta, of which the most familiarexamples are Olympia vincere, or ponlem jungere. In Tacitus Ifind navare bellum, i. e., operam navare bello; Hist. IV., , adliberandum obsidium; Hist. H., , Fidem absolvit; Hist. V., ,Proelia serebant, i. e., manus conserebant proeliis; Hist. II., ,Ne miles segne otium tereret, i. e., segni otio tempus. Some­times he has the same, even when he. gains nothing in brevity.Hist, in., , Ut nube atra diem obtenderent, which differs notmore from the common ut nubem atram diei obtenderent, thanurbem muris circumdare differs from urbi muros. See Hist. II., ,Formam deae paucis disserere. Editors ought to have recognisedthe same usage in Hist. III., , Hue illuc tracturus interpretatio-nem, i. e., res interpretatione. To the same head I refer, Hist. I., ,In utrumque latus transverberatus.



. By attraction not brevity indeed, but rapidity is favored; thenumber of words is not diminished, but of pauses, and the membersof the sentences are more closely connected together. Nouns areattracted from their state of apposition, and are forced into the rela­tion of adjectives. Hist. I., , Uno amne discretis, i. e., una re,amne; Hist. IV., , Celerum rulgus, i. e., ceteri, vulgus; Hist.III. , Aderant vis el peevnia et ruentis fortunae novissima libido.

 ESSAY ON THE



To the same class belong, Agr. , Cum Cerialis quidem alteriussuccessoris curam . . . obruisset, and, G. , Cetera domus officiouxor ac liberi exsequuntur. To destroy the attraction by insertinga comma here, may adapt the construction to our ears, but wouldnot exhibit the thought in the light in which it was viewed by theancients. In the same way I read, Hist; II., , Quam altiore abinitio repetam, i. e., altius, ab initio.



To a similar attraction belong nominatives with infinitives, afterthe example of the Greek and Latin poets : Hist. IV., , Socius(esse) jactabat; Hist. IV., , Cognitus est confugisse ; Hist. II.,, Legiones secuturae sperabantur; Hist. IV., , Vis et armasatis placebant, i. e., vim et arma satis fore placebat; and, H., ,Ipse qui suadet considerandus est adjiciatne, etc. Agr. , hasbeen correctly restored, Momenta ipsa deficientis . . . nunciataconstabant; Hist. I., , Muta ista et inanima intercidere ac re-.parari promiscua sunt.



Of the same class the following is a very common specimen:Hist. II., , Sufficere videbatur . . . pars copiarum et dux Mucia-nus et Vespasiam nomen et nihil arduum fatis, i. e., et ouod nihilarduum esset fatis; Hist. V., , Obstitit formido et remiges peralia militiae munia dispersi.



. Thus far I have examined those sources of brevity whichmay be referred to the established rules of grammar. There areother examples which cannot be explained under a grammatical term.For example, sometimes the narrative hastens forward so rapidly thatit includes two different events in the same expression: Hist. I., ,Laco praefectus tanquam in insulam seponeretur ab evocato quernad caedem ejus Otho praemiserat confossus; Ann. XVI., , Quidum assident, dum deflentis saepe eodem rogo cremabantur. Inthe latter, the state of disease, and in the former, the act of goingforth, which were intermediate, are passed by in silence. AddHist. III., . Also Hist. II., , is obscure for the same reason:Ludicro initio, ni numerus caesorum invidiam Vitellio (MS. bello)auxisset. For the primary idea, ni numerus caesorum magnusfuisset, lurks concealed as it were in a single word. And Tacitusquite often did not condescend to relate those things the knowledgeof which was necessary for clearly understanding the order of events,provided that readers, sufficiently attentive and discerning, couldfollow him by their own judgment or sagacity. Thus in Hist. I., ,it is said that when Otho assigned the consulship to Vopiscus, pleri-que Viennensium honori datum interprelabantur, where the reasonfor such a construction cannot be clearly seen, unless we decide thatVopiscus was an inhabitant of Vienna. Yet that fact is nowhere

stated. I have noticed a similar example in Hist. II., . But I knowof no more remarkable instance than Agr. , where the words naveprima transgressus wore obscure, until it was discovered that Agri-cola had gone over (the previous autumn) from Britain to the con­tinent, or even to Rome, a fact which Tacitus does not mention.



. Since now such a studied brevity seems to involve a depart­ure from usage, and to favor a copiousness of matter rather than tosubserve the beauties of style, Tacitus makes a compensation bylaboring intently to adorn his language, in order that he may not losethe praise of eloquence.



Of the ancienf authors of history, Caesar wrote in a style, pure,graceful and devoid of all ornament, not departing from the ordinarymodes of expression on 'Jie one part, and yet on the other avoidingthe vulgarity of colloquial language by a somewhat artificial compo­sition. Sallust was fond of antiquated expressions and wrote in astyle of peculiar gravity, still carefully preserving simplicity. Livyapplied ornament to his diction, and sought the praise of eloquence.But Tacitus believed that a kind of magnificence and sublimity ofstyle was peculiarly adapted to the dignity of history. And in this,indeed, he resembled Thucydides, who himself also had cultivated astyle widely removed from the ordinary eloquence of other writers;not for want of genius, or through ignorance of letters, as somesuppose, but intentionally and understandingly, that he might notseem to have furnished the lovers of pleasure with a mere iywwr/,aIs tJ ,raporxpw,i-* In other respects there is almost a greater differ­ence between these writers, than resemblance.! For the Grecianwriter, in discussions and orations, is especially and peculiarly con­densed and bold, though in his boldness approaching nearer tothe austerity of philosophers than to the ornament of poets; while innarration his style is very clear and flowing. Tacitus, on the con­trary, shaped his narrative to the cast of his own mind, therein rival­ling the vigor and boldness of poets; but as often as he interwoveorations, he contented himself with obeying the ordinary rules ofeloquence. In fine, there is no essential difference between hisstyle and that of poetry; and strangely inconsistent are they, whorefuse to Tacitus the use of any word or construction, while theyfreely grant the same to poets. And rarely indeed does he, whilelaboring to be brief, become - obscure, as is usually the case in a



* I. e.," a mere prize essay for temporary applause." The expression is quotedfrom the Introduction of Thucydides' History, in which, as he says, he gives tothe public K-rijpa is ill paWov, ^ iy,a,Ktrfta zs rd ,rapa^p,ji,a. Ed.

matter so difficult and hazardous, (and when he seems to be so, ithappens oftener through the fault of transcribers than through hisown) : though not unfrequently when he strives to be sublime, hebecomes, not bombastic indeed, but he is thought to depart too farfrom a proper simplicity.



. And first, the style of Tacitus is terse, polished and elaborate.Rarely, in comparison with his frequent use of other idioms, do wefind in his works those anacolutha,the use of which with otherwriters presents the appearance, sometimes of a pleasing negligence,sometimes of a disagreeable carelessness. I have noticed a few,/?. g., in Ann. XII., ; Hist. III., ; IV., , etc..



If he sometimes so arranged his words as to appear to havearingled different constructions, it ought not to be supposed that hedid this without a design: Ann. III., , Perferre non toleravit, asDial. , Maturare editionem festino, or, G. , Initium inchoate.This appeared to him somewhat stronger than that common accumu­lation of words, pertulit ac toleravit, which Cicero would prefer, asif this latter would add to the number of words, while his own ar­rangement would increase their power.



The concurrence of genitives, which is so annoying wherever it isfound, he carefully avoided, by employing the figure Hendiadys.Of the nature and advantage of this figure C. Roth has treated in alearned and critical manner.



. Moreover he paid a tribute of regard to ornament, in that hedid not use special or trite words, particularly those which are calledtechnical terms. He avoided these even when he thus lost some­thing in brevity. Hence, by a sort of circumlocution, he preferredto write, Hist. III., , ludicrum juvenum rather than Juvenalia.In Dial. , he says, almost obscurely, jus civitatis for jure civili;whence has arisen confidence in the conjecture of Bach, which pro­poses as a correction, in Hist. IV., , de hello civium for the corruptcivilium, and the common correction civili. Perhaps the MediceanMS. reads correctly, in Hist. II., , ponte Mulvi, where the editionshave Mulvio; since in Ann. I., ; III., ., he says campus Martis.



Hence in the distinction of Latin synonyms, the authority of Taci­tus is more suspicious than that of poets. For he disregards (partic­ularly in antitheses) and spurns set and trite words.



Kindred to this peculiarity is his rejection of foreign words, par­ticularly from the Greek, even though they had been naturalized bythe Latins. Nowhere, except in the Dialogue, does he use the termphilosophi: he says, sapientes, although the ideas are unlike. Herarely uses the term poeta: he generally says vates. Rejecting asylum,tie says subsidium. There is a remarkable example of this kind in



STYLE OP TACITUS. 



Ann. XV., , Miliehus praemiis dilatus, Conservatoris nomen Graecoejus rei vocabulo assumpsit. Yet he does not maintain so rigid and.offensive an observance of this peculiarity as to avoid the use ofwhatever has a foreign sound; he admits some such words, as tropaea,asylum, chlamys, catapulla, acinaces.



. He hesitated not to revive ancient words, and forms of words,wlich had been condemned by the refinement of the Ciceronian andthe Augustan age, believing that there is more brilliancy in that whichsavors of antiquity. Editors have retained the datives senatu, nuru,luxu, as also in Ann. IV., , Persi for Persei; but at the sametime they have rejected many ancient forms, lest Tacitus should ap­pear too unlike Cicero. In Ann. IV., , the Medicean MS. hascompossivere, and not composuere; and Ann. XIII., ; Hist. III.,, cornum not cornu. It is easy indeed to correct such expressionsaccording to the usage of Cicero, and to ridicule and charge withsuperstition those who rest their judgment upon the authority of asingle MS. But if it is right carefully to pursue truth even in thesmallest matters, if it is right to reverence even with pious feeling notonly the sentiments but the literary tastes and little preferences ofgreat, geniuses, there is nothingâ€”in matters which cannot be settledby any laws of human reason nor decided by any acuteness of judg­mentâ€”there is nothing which I will trust sooner than even a singleMS. It should, therefore, be well considered, whether, as in Germ., juvenior is retained without any other example; so in Ann. VI.,, venditio et emitio ought not to be retained, for which emptio isnow read; and in Ann. IV., , have preferred to change the cor­rupt telerani into ietulerant rather than into tulerant. Editors haveretained other readings also, which had long since gone out of date,as Hist. I., , necdum for nondum; and Ann. ILL, , munera fungi.Nay, even the genitive vis has succeeded in maintaining its place,Dial. . And yet Ann. XIV., , expergens; Ann. I., , false; Ann.LL, , the singular sacri for hostiae; Hist. I., , decori juventa,which are in no respect more unusual, have not obtained the sameindulgence. It is surely a questionable scrupulosity which refusessuch words to a writer who desired to be unique, and who did noteven obtain an imitator, by a comparison with whom one can deter­mine what he did and what he did not approve.



On the other hand, Tacitus, in my opinion, coined few new words ;unless, perchance, same one may think that all those words, whichare found in his writings alone, were of course originated by him.But it is extremely difficult to decide whether Tacitus was the firstto use any word, or whether we read it for the first time in his wri­tings. So long as he corresponds to all the rules for forming words,

so far at least I think we ought to grant the indulgence to a writerwho is universally acknowledged to have entertained no very greatoorror of the charge of novelty. Irreverentia, improsper, do indeedsavor of novelty, as the invidentia of Cicero does, but they are con­ceded to Tacitus by all. I have not hesitated to propose-by way ofcorrection, in Hist. II., , the strange frequentative retorlant. InAnn. XVI., , expectabilis is sufficiently defended by the authorityof Tertullian; and I do not regret having recommended confestinan-lius in Ann. XV., , and exaperlae in Hist. V., ; or having de­fended indictus favor in Hist. III., .



. But as an innovator in the construction cf words he was ex­ceedingly fruitful. He delighted in the unusual, as if itself anornament, even though he gained nothing either in brevity or graceof style ; as if he remembered the precept of Horace,



Dixeris egregie, notum si callida verbumReddiderit Junctura novum.



l know not what other Latin author would have said ulilis pro nobis,Agr. . I refrain from other examples, as they are obvious in everypart of his works. In the use of the historical infinitive also, hediffers from other writers by transferring it to present circumstancesand customs of long standing. I would not have believed it, had notthree instances conspired to prove it, still unchanged by all the per­tinacious industry of editors, who, while they dispose of separate ex­amples, have forgotten the others. These are Germ. , audiri;Agr. , mere; and Dial. , insumere. I am inclined to think afourth ought to be added, Ann. III., , Tot a mqjoribus repertaeleges . . . contemptu abolitae securiorem luxum facere, where editorshave fecere; not to mention those places in which I have recalled theusual infinitives from the MSS., Ann. I., ; II., . ; VI., ;Hist. IV., ; to which I ought to add Hist. II., , Facem Auguslalessubdere; and III., , Quo pudore haud plures quam centum equitesresistere; and V., , Pace per Ilaliam parta el eocternae curae redire,where editions have subdidere, and restitere, and rediere. For nopeculiarity of the Latin language might be expected to be morepleasing to Tacitus, none can be imagined better adapted to his style,so that I do not wonder that, in using it, he sometimes dared to gobeyond proper limits. He may have shown audacity, and almostviolence, but it would be a mark of even greater audacity and ex­travagance for us, who were born so many ages after him, in oppo­sition to so many examples, which are defended by the authority ofthe MSS., and which not even the genius of the language convictsof fault, to attempt forcibly to abridge this license, merely from a

comparison with other writers, to whom our author intended to beunlike.



Tacitus indulges in Greek constructions, such as are used only bya few, or by himself alone. For ancient writers, from the com­mencement of the Grace-Latin literature, had introduced manyGracisms into the Latin language, most of which the following agedropped in order to introduce others in their stead. See Agr. ,Ceterorum Britannorum fugacissimi, an expression which the elderPliny had used before. Also Hisj;. IV., , Id nomen appellantur;and Dial. , the words, pro Catone magis, resemble the Greek.



. Tacitus exerted himself particularly to secure concinnky, somuch so that he rarely neglected it, and some portions he adornedwith exquisite art by the use of this rhetorical beauty. He evenadded superfluous words, provided they would contribute to concin-nity; as Hist. II., , Quidam miliium errore vEEi seu turbarumstudio certatim aggregabantur. He even disregarded the rules ofgrammar in his fondness for this ornament: e. g., Ann. IV., , Adconjugii spent, consortium regni et necem mariti impulit, where theidea of consortium ought to depend upon spem, and therefore wouldregularly be in the genitive.



He was careful to close his periods with well-chosen clausules,whence that disagreement with grammatical rules in Ann. XTV, ,Species carminum . . . non uno fluens; and Germ. , Pecorum fe-cunda sed plerumque improcera. Furthermore he observed the lawof variety with solicitous care, sometimes for the sake of euphony,as Ann. II., , quibusâ€”quis; sometimes to avoid the appearance ofpoverty in forms of expression. In this way he has sometimestroubled the reader, Ann. XV., , Verginium Rufum claritudonominis expulit; nam Verginius studiajuvenum eloquently, Musoniuspraeceptis sapientiae fovebat. In Hist. LL, , he employs the sameartifice, Calonum numerus amplior, procacissimis etiam inter servoslixarum ingeniis; where he puts lixae instead of calones, in the lastclause, for variety, both classes (cooks and campboys) being em­braced under each name. But he is particularly fond of varying theconstruction by enallage; e. g., Hist. II., , Illa Syriae, hoc Ju-daeae caput est; Agr. , ut.. decorum infrontem, itafugientibuspericulosissima.



Very often he shows his love of variety in passing from the activeto the passive, and vice versa; Hist. IV., ; Germ. , Nam nectributis contemnuntur, nec publicanus adterit; and Hist. HI., ,Igndrus miliiiae, improvidus consiliis, where editions have consilii.



Frequently he varies the form of construction, as if for no otherpurpose than to exhibit the richness of his mother tongue, and to

show that the freedom of Latin writers could be abridged by no rigidand arbitrary rules: 'e. g., Ann. I., , Plurimi detrita tegmina etnudum corpus exprobantes; Hist. IV. , Neque aliud excusandumhabeo, quam quod vos Gallici foederis oblitos praedixerim, memoriamRomani sacramenii lenere credidi. C. Roth has collected and ex­plained many examples in Agr. Ex. XIII.



He also makes frequent use of the figures of rhetoric, in order torender his style brilliant, particularly of the antithesis: Hist. L,, Omnia sEkviLItER pro domiNatioNE ; Ann. II., , Spe vicTOkiaEinducti sunt ut yiscEkENTuR ; Hist. I., , Uno amne disckETiscoNNExtjm odium. Alliterations also, to which Latin authors aresomewhat tempted by the very nature of their language: e. g., Ann.I., , si poenitentiam, quam perniciem malebat; A. , virtus ....vicit vitium. Moreover he abounds in what we call in barbarous Latinallusiones. No one is ignorant into what absurdities the scrupulous­ness of commentators has fallen, who, as often as they find certainwords, similar to those of some former writer, cry out at once, " imi­tation." But Tacitus often does not imitate others, but rather alludesto them, especially the poets, by repeating some words, remarkableeither for beauty of sentiment or felicity of expression, and thus ex­citing a pleasing recollection in his readers. And it is often doubtfulwhether he did this wittingly or unwittingly. Now none of the poetswas better known, or more celebrated at that age, than Virgil, whosewords, Haec ubi dicta dedit, Livy long ago had not hesitated to in­troduce into his narrative. Numberless expressions from the sameauthor may be found in Tacitus, scattered here and there. Morerarely will you find the words of Horace ; as, Ann. XV., , Ex ilhcontaminatorum grege, coll. Carm. I., , , for I do not believe, that,in common prose, eunuchs come under the term contaminati. No­where, so far as I know, does he allude to Ovid, a writer entirelyunlike himself in taste and style, for I am not of the opinion that thewords in Agr. , were drawn from Ovid. Of prose writers hequoted Sallust most frequently. From a comparison with Livy,Trillerus has made a Â£ood correction in Hist. II., . Near theclose of Agricola he manifestly refers his readers to a most beautifulpassage of Cicero de Oratore. If I have rightly corrected Agr. ,he has there quoted verbatim the language of Seneca. It were easyalso to traoe resemblances between Tacitus, Demosthenes, Thucy-dides, and Plato; and the verses of Homer are recognised in Hist. I., ; and Agr. .



Thus much concerning the style of Tacitus. If I had undertaken towrite a book on Tacitus, many topics would still remain to be discussedtouching the genius of the writer, and his political and religious

opinions; touching his learning, his fidelity, and his skill as an histo­rian. But now, since I have no other purpose than to write a prefaceto my edition, I have briefly discussed some subjects and have passedDy others, particularly those which it is evidently better to omit, thanto treat briefly and therefore unsatisfactorily. And it is better thatthose who start such questions should consult those books, (and theyare not a few), in which the ideas of men of pre-eminent talent havebeen ably and fully unfolded. But concerning the style of our au­thor I have treated a little more extensively, in order to compensatefor the small number and briefness of my notes; and, at the sametime, if I should seem to have used too great boldness in either ex­pressing an opinion or making a correction, to defend my position bybringing together under a single view the scattered examples. Forthis I have chiefly labored, and not with the more ambitious aim toset forth a sort of image and picture of the style of Tacitus. Who­ever shall undertake this, will find not a few who will repeat to himihese lines of Goethe:

Nam, post conditam urbem octingentos et vigintiprions aevi annos multi auctores retulerunt, dum res populiRomani memorabantur, pari eloquentia ac libertate : post-quam bellatum apud Actium atque omnem potentiam ad unum conferri pacis interfuit, magna illa ingenia cessere;simul Veritas pluribus modis infracta, primum inscitia rei-publicae^ut alienae,)mox libidinj assentandi, aut rursus odioadversus dominantes : ita neutris cura posteritatis, inter in- *fensos vel obnoxjos. Sed/ambitionem scriptoris facile ad- verseris/ obtrectatio et Tivor pronis auribus accipiuntur:quippe adulationi foedum crimen servitutis, malignitati falsaspecies libertatis inest.

Et Nym-phidius quidem in ipso conatu oppressus: sed, quamviscapite defectionis ablato, manebat plerisque militum con- scientia; nec deerant sermones, senium atque avaritiamGalbae increpantium.

ut haud minus vitia principum amarent, quam olim virtutes verebantur.* Accessit Galbae vox, pro republica honesta,ipsi anceps, " legi a se militem, non emi." Nec enim adbanc formam cetera erant.



VI. Invalidum senem T. Vinius et Cornelius Laco, alter .deterrimus mortalium, alter ignavissimus, odio flagitiorum oneratum contemptu inertiae destruebant. Tardum Galbaeiter et cruentum, interfectis Cingonio Varrone consule de-signato et Petronio Turpiliano consulari: ille, ut Nymphi-dii socius, hie, ut dux Neronis, inauditi atque indefensi,tanquam innocentes, perierant. Introitus in urbem, truci- datis tot millibus inermium militum, infaustus omine, atqueipsis etiam qui occiderant formidolosus. Inducta legioneHispana, remanente ea quam e classe Nero conscripserat,plena urbs exercitu insolito: multi ad hoc numeri e Ger-mania ac Britannia et Illyrico, quos idem Nero electos praemissosque ad claustra Caspiarum et bellum quod inAlbanos parabat, opprimendis Vindicis coeptis revocaverat:ingens novis rebus materia, ut non in unum aliquem pronofavore, ita audenti parata.

Aquinus et Fabius Valens legati legionuni interfecerant,antequam juberentur. Fuere qui crederent, Capitonem, utavaritia et libidine foedum ac maculosum, ita cogitationererum novarum abstinuisse ; sed a legatis, bellum suadenti- bus, postquam impellere nequiverint, crimen ac dolum ultrocompositum: at Galbam mobilitate ingenii, an ne altiusscrutaretur, quoquo modo acta, quia mutari non poterant,comprobasse. Ceterum utraque caedes sinistre accepta;et inviso semel principe, seu bene seu male facta premunt.



 Jam afterebant venalia cuncta praepotentes liberti; servo-rum manus subitis avidae, et tanquam apud senem festi-nantes; eademque novae aulae mala, aeque gravia, nonaeque excusata. Ipsa aetas Galbae irrisui ac fastidio eratassuetis juventae Neronis et imperatores forma ac decore

Neque abhorrebat a Berenice ju­venilis animus; sed gerendis rebus nullum ex eo impedi-mentum: laetam voluptatibus adolescentiam egit, suo quampatris imperio moderatior. Igitur oram Achaiae et Asiae ac laeva maris praevectus, Rhodum et Cyprum insulas,inde Syriam audentioribus spatiis petebat.

Sed neque Aponiuscuncta, ut trepidans re subita, perscripserat, et amici adu-lantes mollius interpretabantur : unius legionis eam sedi-tionem, ceteris exercitibus constare fidem. In bunc modumetiam Vitellius apud milites disseruit, praetorianos nuper exauctoratos insectatus, a quibus falsos rumores dispergi,nec ullum civilis belli metum asseverabat, suppresso Ves­pasiani nomine et vagis per urbem militibus, qui sermonespopuli coercerent: id praecipuum alimentum famae erat.

Antonius per Flaminiam ad Saxa rubra multojam noctis serum auxilium venit. Illic interfectum Sabinum, conflagrasse Capitolium, tremere urbem, maesta omnia ac-cepit: plebem quoque et servitia pro Vitellio armari nun-tiabatur. Et Petilio Ceriali equestre proelium adversumfuerat: namque incautum et tanquam ad victos ruentemVitelliani, interjectus equiti pedes, excepere. Pugnatum baud procul urbe inter aedificia hortosque et anfractus via-rum; quae gnara Vitellianis, incomperta hostibus, metumfecerant: neque omnis eques concors, adjunctis quibusdamqui nuper apud Narniam dediti fortunam partium specula--bantur. Capitur praefectus alae Tullius Flavianus: ceteri foeda fuga consternantur, non ultra Fidenas secutis victo-ribus.

Agit grates Vitellius, et ad tuendam urbem prorumpere jubet.Mox vocato senatu deliguntur legati ad exercitus, ut prae-texto reipublicae concordiam pacemque suaderent. Varialegatorum sors fuit. Qui Petilio Ceriali occurrerant, extre-mum discrimen adiere, aspernante milite conditiones pacis: vulneratur praetor Arulenus Kusticus : auxit invidiam, su­per violatum legati praetorisque nomen, propria dignatioviri: palantur comites, occiditur proximus lictor, dimovereturbam ausus: et ni dato a duce praesidio defensi forent,sacrum etiam in exteras gentes legatorum jus ante ipsa pa- triae moenia civilis rabies usque in exitium temerasset.Aequioribus animis accepti sunt, qui ad Antonium venerant,non quia modestior miles, sed duci plus auctoritatis.

LXXXII. Tentavit tamen Antonius vocatas ad concionem- legiones mitigare, ut castris juxta pontem Mulvium positis, postera die urbem ingrederentur. Ratio cunctandi, ne as-peratus proelio miles non populo, non senatui, ne templisquidem ac delubris deorum consuleret. Sed omnem prola-tionem ut inimicam victoriae suspectabant. Simul fulgentiaper colles vexilla, quanquam imbellis populus sequeretur, speciem hostilis exercitus fecerant. Tripartito agmine pars,ut adstiterat, Flaminia via, pars juxta ripam Tiberis incessit;tertium agmen per Salariam Collinle jportae propinquabat.Plebs invectis equitibus fusa: miles Vitellianus trims et ipsepraesidiis occurrit. Proelia ante urbem multa et varia, sed Flavianis consilio ducum praestantibus saepius prospera. Iitantum conflictati sunt, qui in partem sinistram urbis adSallustianos hortos per angusta et lubrica viarum flexerant.Superstantes maceriis hortorum Vitelliani ad serum usquediem saxis pilisque subeuntes arcebant, donee ab equitibus, qui porta Collina irruperant, circumvenirentur.

INTERfEcTo Vitellio, bellum magis desierat quam paxcoeperat. Armati per urbem victores implacabili odiovictos conseotabantur : plenae caedibus viae, cruenta foratemplaque, passim trucidatis, ut quemque fors obtulerat.Ac mox augescente licentia, scrutari ac protrahere abditos; si quem procerum habitu et juventa conspexerant, obtrun-care, nullo militum aut populi discrimine. Quae saevitia,recentibus odiis, sanguine explebatur, dein verterat in ava-ritiam; nihil usquam secretum aut clausum sinebant, Vitelli-anos occultari simulantes. Initium id perfringendarum do- muum, vel, si resisteretur, causa caedis; nec deerat egen-tissimus quisque e plebe et pessimi servitiorum prodereultro dites dominos : alii ab amicis monstrabantur. Ubiquelamenta, conolamationes, et fortunae captae urbis, adeo utOthoniani Vitellianique militis invidiosa antea petulantia desideraretur. Duces partium accendendo civili bello acres,temperandae victoriae impares : quippe in tmbas et discor-dias pessimo cuique plurima vis; pax et quies bonis artibusindigent.

Civitas pavida et servitio parataoccupari redeuntem Tarracina L. Vitellium cum cohortibus, exstinguique reliqua belli postulabat. Praemissi Ariciamequites; agmen legionum intra Bovillas stetit. Nec cunc-tatus est Vitellius seque et cohortes arbitrio victoris per-mittere, et miles infelicia arma haud minus ira quam metuabjecit. Longus deditorum ordo septus armatis per urbem



 incessit. Nemo supplici vultu, sed tristes et truces et ad-versum plausus ac lasciviam insultantis vulgi immobiles:paucos erumpere ausos circumjecti pressere; ceteri in cus-todiam conditi. Nihil quisquam locutus indignum, et quan-quam inter adversa, salva virtutis fama. Dein L. Vitellius



 interficitur, par vitiis fratris, in principatu ejus vigilantior,nec perinde prosperis socius quam adversis abstractus.

 habetur. Solatio fuit servus Verginii Capitonis, quem pro-ditorem Tarracinensium diximus, patibulo affixus in iisdemannulis quos acceptos a Vitellio gestabat. At Romae sena-tus cuncta principibus solita Vespasiano decernit, laetus etspei certus : quippe sumpta per G-allias Hispaniasque civilia



 arma, motis ad bellum Germanis, mox Illyrico, postquamAegyptum, Judaeam Syriamque, et omnes provincias ex-ercitusque lustraverant, velut expiato terrarum orbe, cepissefinem videbantur. Addidere alacritatem Vespasiani literae,' tanquam manente bello scriptae: ea, prima specie, forma:

Id vero erga rempublicam superbum, erga Principem contumeliosum, quod in manu sua ftiisse impe-rium donatumque Vespasiano jactabat. Ceterum invidiain occulto; adulatio in aperto erant: multo cum honoreverborum Muciano triumphalia de bello civium data: sed

Ceterum eo senatus die,quo de imperio Vespasiani censebant, placuerat mitti ad Principem legatos. Hinc inter Helvidium et Eprium acrejurgium. Priscus eligi nominatim a magistratibus juratis,Marcellus urnam postulabat, quae consulis designati sen-tentia fuerat.

IX. Secutum aliud certamen. Praetores aerarii (namtum a praetoribus tractabatur aerarium) publicam pauper-tatem questi, modum impensis postulaverant. Earn curamconsul designatus, ob magnitudinem oneris et remedii diffi-cilltatem, Principi reservabat. Helvidius arbitrio senatus agendum censuit.

LIV. Audita interim per Gallias Germaniasque morsVitellii duplicaverat bellum. Nam Civilis, omissa dissimu-latione, in populum Romanum ruere; Vitellianae legiones vel externum servitium quam Imperatorem Vespasianummalle. Galli sustulerant animos, eandem ubique exercitu-um nostrorum fortunam rati, vulgato rumore a SarmatisDacisque Moesica ac Pannonica hiborna circumsideri: pariade Britannia fingebantur. Sed nihil aeque quam incendium Capitolii, ut finem imperio ad^sse crederent, impulerat." Captam olim a Gallis urbem: sed, integra Jovis sede,mansisse imperium. Fatali nunc igne signum coelestis iraedatum, et possessionem rerum humanarum Transalpinis gen-tibus portendi," superstitione vana Druidae canebant. In- cesseratque fama primores Galliarum ab Othone adversusVitellium missos, antequam digrederentur, pepigisse, ne dc-essent libertati, si populum Romanum continua civiliumbellorum series et interna mala fregissent.



LV. Ante Flacci Hordeonii caedem nihil prorupit, quo conjuratio intelligeretur. Interfecto Hordeonio, commea-vere nuntii inter Civilem Classicumque praefcctum alaeTreverorum. Classicus nobilitate opibusque ante alios.Regium illi genus et pace belloque clara origo. Ipse emajoribus suis hostis populi Romani quam socius jactabat. Miscuere sese Julius Tutor et Julius Sabinus, hie Trevir, hieLingonus. Tutor ripae Rheni a Vitellio praefectus; Sa­binus super insitam vanitatem falsae stirpis gloriae incen- ,debatur: proaviam suam divo Julio per Gallias bellanticorpore atq^e adulterio placuisse. Hi secretis sermonibus animos ceterorum scrutari: ubi quos idoneos rebantur con-ecientia obstrinxere, in colonia Agrippinensi in domum pri- *vatum conveniunt; nam publice civitas talibus inceptisabhorrebat: attamen interfuere quidam Ubiorum Tungro-rumque. Sed plurima vis penes Treveros ac Lingonas: nec tulere moras consultandi: certatim proclamant furerediscordiis populum Romanum, caesas legiones, vastatamItaliam, capi cum maxime urbem, omnes exercitus suis

LVI. Haec dicta pariter probataque : de reliquiis Vitelli- ani exercitus dubitavere. Plerique interficiendos censebant,turbidos, infidos, sanguine ducum pollutes. Vicit ratio par-cendi, ne sublata spe veniae pertinaciam accenderent: al-liciendos potius in societatem ; legatis tantum legionum in-terfectis, ceterum vulgus conscientia scelerum et spe impu-

 et occultos hostes, optimum e praesentibus ratus mutuadissimulatione et iisdem quibus petebatur grassari, in colo-niam Agrippinensem descendit. Illuc Claudius Labeo,quem captum et extra conventum amandatum in Frisiosdiximus, corruptis custodibus perfugit; pollicitusque, si prae-

Agrippinenses sumpto consultandi spatio, quandoneque subire conditiones metus futuri neque palam aspernariconditio praesens sinebat, in bunc modum respondent:" Quae prima libertatis facultas data est, avidius quamcautius sumpsimus, ut vobis ceterisque Germanis consan- guineis nostris jungeremur.

Praecipua victoriae fides dux hostium Valen-tinus, nequaquam abjecto animo, quos spiritus gessisset,vultu ferebat. Auditus ideo tantum ut nosceretur inge-nium ejus, damnatusque, inter ipsum supplicium, expro- branti cuidam patriam ejus captam, " accipere se solatiummortis" respondit. Sed Mucianus quod diu occultaverat,ut recens exprompsit: " quoniam benignitate deum fractaevires hostium forent, parum decore Domitianum, confectoprope bello, alienae gloriae interventurum. Si status imperii aut salus Galliarum in discrimine verteretur, debuisse Cae-sarem in acie stare: Canninefates Batavosque minoribusducibus delegandos. Ipse Lugduni vim fortunamque prin-cipatus e proximo ostentaret, nec parvis periculis immixtuset majoribus non defuturus."

Unde credi-tur Domitianus occultis ad Cerialem nuntiis fidem ejustentavisse, an praesenti sibi exercitum imperiumque tradi-turus foret: qua cogitatione bellum adversus patrem agita- verit, an opes viresque adversus fratrem in incerto fuit:nam Cerialis salubri temperamento elusit ut vana puerilitercupientem. Domitianus sperni a senioribus juventam suamcernens, modica quoque et usurpata antea munia imperiiomittebat, simplicitatis ac modestiae imagine in altitudinem conditus, studiumque literarum et amorem carminum simu-lans, quo velaret animum et fratris aemulationi subducere-tur, cujus disparem mitioremque naturam contra interpreta-batar.

PRELIMINARY REMARKS.



ThE historical writings of Tacitus, as we now have them, consist of frag­ments of two distinct yet not wholly disconnected works, " the Histories"and " the Annals." The former originally comprised fourteen Books, andembraced a period of twenty-eight years, from the second consulship of Gsibato the death of Domitian, of which only the first four Books and a small portionof the fifth remain, containing the history of only about one year. The latteiconsisted, when entire, of sixteen Books, and extended over the space of fifty-four years, from the death of Augustus to the close of the reign of Nero; butfour entire Books are lost, from the seventh to the tenth inclusive, and thefifth, eleventh and sixteenth are preserved only in part. The Histories hadfor their subject the civil wars of Galba, Otho and Vitellius, and the re-estab­lishment of the imperial power under the Flavian family (His. ,). Thesubject of the Annals was the gradual corruption of morals and manners, andthe consequent subversion, pari passu, of liberty and law under the Julianand Claudian families, till at length on the death of Nero the military gamedthe entire ascendency over the civil power, and the commander of the strong­est army seated himself on the throne in place of the undisputed hereditarysuccession of the Caesars (Ann. ,. ). If the author's life had been spared,it was his purpose to have written the Life of Augustus, as a sort of introduc­tion to his Annals (Ann. ,), and the Biographies of Nerva and Trajan as asequel to the Histories (His. ,). But he did not live to execute either ofthese cherished plans.



In the MSS. and early editions, the Annals and the Histories appear as onework, and the extant Books of both, counted in the same numerical series,bear the common inscription, sometimes of Annates or Histories or ActaDiurnalia, and sometimes only of the historian's name. They must havebeen so arranged and numbered, in some copies at least, as early as the age ofJerome (a. d. -), for in his Commentary on Zachariah, ,, that Chris­tian Father refers to Cornelius Tacitus, as having written the Lives of theCresars from the death of Augustus to that of Domitian in thirty Books,*thus comprehending the two works in one, which covers the whole period oftime belonging to both. But Tertullian, who flourished in the latter part of



* It is chiefly from this number of Jerome, that we are able to make out thenumber of Books comprised in the original Histories. The Annals are known tohave consisted of sixteen Books, which subtracted from thirty eave fourteen forthe Histories.



 NOTES.



the second century, cites the speculations of Tacitus touching the origin of thÂ«Jews, as occurring in the fifth Book of his Histories, and thus shows, that â– his day the works were distinct and the Books wera numbered separately, asthey are now. And that they were intended to form separate treatises, is de­monstrated by incontrovertible evidence external and internal. This is suffi­ciently apparent from the introductory chapters, which are manifestly prefa­tory in both, and which mark the limits of the two works, as entirely distinct,though chronologically successive. Tacitus expressly calls his Annals by thatname (Ann. , ; , ; , ), while he refers to the Books in which he hadcomposed the history of Domitiau, as a separate work (Ann. , ). AndPliny refers with equal explicitness to the latter under the title of Historiae(Ep. ,). There remains therefore no reasonable doubt, that Tacitus him­self gave to his two great historical compositions the same distinguishing titleswhich they now bear. To the question, what distinction he thus intended tomark, different answers are returned by critics and defended with much learn­ing and zeal.



One difference seems to lie on the face of the works, as chronologically re­lated to the author. The Histories cover the age of the historian himself; theAnnals embrace a period anterior to his appearance on the stage of activelife. And this distinction accords with the original and proper signification ofthe word history, which in Greek implies personal inspection or investigation,and which many Greek and Latin authors carefully distinguish, not only fromtradition and hearsay, but also from the authentic records of bygone days.*



Another obvious difference is suggested by the literal meaning of the wordannals, which was originally applied to the yearly register of passing eventskept by the Pontiffs (Annales Maximi or Annales Pontificum), and then tothe chronicles of Pictor, Piso and others who were the pioneers of the Romanhistorians, and which in its etymology implies a strictly chronological arrange­ment of the events that occur year by year. This also accords with the actualdifference between the Histories and the Annals of Tacitus. The Historiesnarrate events according to their geographical connection, or the relation ofcause and effect, or they adopt, on rhetorical principles, the arrangementwhich will produce the most picturesque and striking impression. The Annals,on the contrary, follow strictly the chronological order, relating under eachyear the events of that year and no other (cf.

Other distinctions have been drawn between annals and history, such astheseâ€”that annals are a simple detail of facts, while history further investi­gates the causes and consequences of the events which are recorded; and that,while annals are written in a straight-forward, inartificial and unadorned style,history is composed in a more studied, ornate and flowing diction, descriptionsof countries and battles are interwoven with the narrative, fictitious speechesare introduced, such as the speaker or actor might have made whether he didmake them or notâ€”in short, history is a work of art, as much so as an oration,

or an epic or tragic poem. Both these views have received the sanction olgreat names (cf. Aulus Gellius, Noct. Att. ,), and the latter is stampedwith the authority of Cicero (De Orat. ,; De Legg. ,).* These distinc­tions doubtless hold in reference to the Roman annals in general as comparedwith the standard histories, whether of the Romans or the Greeks. But theyapply only in a limited measure to the Histories and the Annals of Tacitus. HisAnnals, not less than his Histories, are marked by profound reflection on thecauses and consequences of eventsâ€”by deep research and penetration into theprinciples of human action. And though the rigidity of structure, which be­longs to the very nature of annals, and the extreme conciseness, which wasdemanded by so vast and comprehensive a subject as that of the Annals ofTacitus, are unfavorable to ornament, yet they abound in animated descrip­tions, eloquent speeches and pictures of human conduct and character drawnwith great power and true to the life. The Histories have been compared toan epic poem, of which the subject is the fortunes of the Flavian family, andall the collateral topics, that are treated, come in by way of prelude or episode.There is still more of the dramatic element both in the Histories and the An­nals, which may well be considered as a prolonged tragedy or a series of trage­dies, whether we contemplate the more than tragic horror of most of the inci­dents, or the consummate art and power with which, they are combined anddescribed.



The Annals are the author's last work. That they were written subsequent­<y to the Histories, we learn from the incidental testimony of the historianhimself (Ann. ,). That they were not completed till near the close of thereign of Trajan, is inferred from Ann. , , where he speaks of the boundariesof the Roman empire as already extended to the Red Sea, which was done byTrajan in the th year of his reign, A. v. c. ; a. d. . The Historiesalso were given to the world in the same reignâ€”in what year is not known,though Trajan had already reigned so long and performed such achievements,that Tacitus had formed a purpose of writing his history together with that otthe deified Nerva (His. ,). The Biography of Agricola was issued near thecommencement of the same reign, as a sort of forerunner to the Histories, ofwhich it contains an announcement (of. A. , and Notes, ibid.), and whichmust therefore have been already contemplated, if not actually begun at thattime. The Treatise on Germania was published not far from the same timewith the Agricola (cf. Special Introductions to those Treatises). The Dialoguede Claris Oratoribus, if the work of Tacitus, was doubtless a much earlier pro­duction. Accordingly it betrays the author's youth in its playful humor andlively emotions, in its exuberance of fancy and the excessive ornaments of itsstyle. Moreover the other works, though all composed in the full strength ofmanhood, exhibit a gradual progress in maturity of thought, in depth of feel­ing and in gravity of expression, in the same order in which they were written.The German Manners and the Life cf Agricola abound in poetic fancies,lively conceits and artificial periods, which he afterwards learned, or chose, ina measure to retrench. Besides the one of these was professedly a pane­gyric, and the other in spirit, though not in form and main design, a satire

The former would of course admit of rhetorical flourishes, and the lalfer ofplayful sallies and sarcastic cuts, which would not become the dignity of history. In his Annals, the author has pruned off still more of the redundancesof his youthful genius, though even there he shows that exuberance was natu­ral to him, that he was endowed by nature with the rhetorical and the poeticalelement in little less profusion than the historical and the philosophical. Itwould be instructive and interesting to trace the progressive development ofthis master-mind, and observe the striking changes, and yet the unequivocalsigns of identity, which mark the history of his intellectual life from the com­mencement of the Dialogue on Oratory to the conclusion of the Annals of theRoman empire. It would be difficult to find a more remarkable example ofdiversity in unity.



The Histories are on the whole perhaps the most perfect production of theauthor's genius, as they are also the most finished work of artâ€”the work onwhich he laid out his strength, and on which he relied to transmit his nameto posterity. They were written when he was nearer fifty than forty, in thevery prime of life, free alike from the foibles of youth and the feebleness ofage, possessing at once imagination in undecayed vigor and judgment inmatured perfection. His resources had been accumulating, as the result oflong observation and reflection. His feelings were chastened and yet deepen­ed by suffering, and his eloquence was matured by study and practice. Hehad spoken at the bar and ruled in the senate. He had served, perhaps com­manded in the Roman armies. Whether he writes of civil or military affairs,he seems alike at home, alike familiar with the arts of war and those of peace.At the same time, he was master of all the lore of books, and all the wisdomof the schools. The principles of philosophy were almost the atmosphere hebreathed. Like Cicero, he combined the high-toned morals of the Stoics withthe more liberal doctrines of the Academy, though he held to the Stoical doc­trine of fate and, sometimes, particularly in his Annals, gives utterance toreligious opinions bordering on those of the Skeptics and Epicureans (Ann.,; , ; , ). The Poets, as well as the Philosophers, were his masters.Virgil especially charmed his ear and touched his heart. The image of theMantuan Bard is stamped on every page, particularly of the historian's earlierwritings.* Nor are there wanting reflections of the style and sense and spiritof Horace. He had also caught the living images and winged words of him," who wandered erst from Scio's rocky isle." The constitution, and laws ofhis country were familiar to him as household words. The civil and politicalhistory of Greece and Rome had been his study and his meditation. He wasa republican by choice, but by necessity, as he thought, an imperialist (His.,.. et passim). He admired the former state of things at Rome, but hesubmitted to the present. He loved liberty, but he loved order more, andhoped to find it only under the throne of the Caesars. He has canonized manya martyr of freedom and damned many a tyrant to eternal infamy. But heabhorred ultraism, censured would-be martyrs and bade the admirers of theimpracticable learn from the example of such men as Agricola, that there

may be great and good subjects under such sovereigns as Domitian (A. )With the public history and the private life of the period of which he writes,he was of course well acquainted, for it was the period of his own active ex­ertions, and most of the events, which he records, either passed under his owneye at Rome, or were brought directly to his ears as they transpired in themore distant provinces. When with a mind so disciplined and so furnished aswe have thus faintly describedâ€”in the full maturity of his powers and withthe utmost richness of materialsâ€”he sat down to write the history of an em­pire which involved the history of the worldâ€”fit author on fit themeâ€”he couldsay, as jEneas did in beginning the story of his country's fall and his ownwanderings:



Quaeque ipse miserrima vidi,Et quorum magna pars mi.



The parallel holds in more than one particular. The events of Tacitus' his­tory, like those of /Eneas' tale, are chiefly sad, disastrous to his country, dis­graceful to her rulers and of melancholy interest to himself; he had seen themwith his own eyes, mourned over them in his inmost heart,* suffered them inhis own person and in the person of his dearest friends; he had acted a some­what conspicuous part as a senator and an orator in those troublous times;partly by his own prudence, partly by some miracle, as it were, which wecannot understand^ he escaped unharmed and with unsullied reputation;and no sooner has he weathered the storm and found a safe and tranquil har­bor, than he gives to the world an able and faithful history of the scenesthrough which he and his country had passed. Well might the historianfelicitate himself on the propitious change in his fortunes and the happinessof that age, in which it was once more lawful for men to think what theypleased and to speak what they thought (His. ,)! Nor have his readersless reason for self-congratulation, that this happy age was preceded by eviltimes, when the historian experienced bitter trials and when the state passedfrom the extreme of bloody anarchy to the extreme of despotic cruelty; forto these experiences we are doubtless indebted for much of his wisdom andeloquence; and though other and inferior minds may have been crushed be­neath the oppressive sway of Domitian, and almost lost the power of memorytogether with the gift of speech (A. , ), this long period of forced silenceonly condensed the swelling .thoughts of Tacitus, compressed his glowingemotions and added intensity to the burning words, in which he spoke, as soonas the pressure was removed.!



Much has been written on the credibility of Tacitus, as a historian. Hisveracity has been impugned.

and defeats. He has been censured by some as a Machiavelli or a LatinXenophon, tl,e author of a Tiberiopaedia, whose design was to teach the art ottyranny in its perfection, and by others as the rigid, malignant and misanthrop­ic censor of princes and of mankind. Such contrad,ctory accusations maywell be left to balance and neutralize each other. No candid reader of Tacituscan regard him as indiscriminate either in censure or in praise.* His worstcharacters are not without their virtues, and his best show their imperfections.He denies, or holds in suspense, crimes which the public voice unanimouslycharged upon the emperors, whom he treats with the most unsparing severity,and has not made either Tiberius or Domitian so bad, as some other writers ofhis age. In short, he manifestly intends to hold the balance of truth and jus­tice with an even hand, and few have better carried out the intention neitherto " extenuate aught or set down aught in malice." It is to be regretted thatTacitus did not take the pains to inform himself better touching the Jews andChristians. But in this he erred only in common with all the great writersand great men of his country (cf. Notes, ,), who were born and bred to de-spiso and ridicule the Jewsâ€”ti hate and psrsecute the Christians.t Moreover,notwithstanding his national prejudices, Tacitus expressly attests the inno­cence of the Christians, who suffered under Nero, and commiserates theirsufferings (Ann. , ), while ho narrates not a little that is true and com­mendable of the Jews, and ascribes to the whole nation a creed touching thedivine nature more pure, more true, more sublime than had ever entered thethoughts of any but the wisest sages of Greece and Rome (His. , ). Tacitusundertakes to write both his Histories and his Annals for the express reason,that no impartial history of that period had been written (His. ,; Ann. ,),but between the parasites and the bitter enemies of those in power, truthand posterity had been forgotten. For himself, he professes perfect candor.From Galba.Otho, and Vitellius, he had received neither benefits nor injuries.The Flavian dynasty was now extinct, and, though they had all conferredhonors upon him, he could speak of them all, unswayed by favor and unawedby fear. And nobly, it must be confessed, nobly does he redeem his pledge.He does not spare the besetting sin of the soldier-like and truly imperial Ves­pasian (His. , ; , ; , , et al.). He does not conceal the youthful vicesof Titus, "delight of the human race" (His. ,; ,). Still less does hewithhold his severest animadversions from Domitian (Agr. -), whilo hebears grateful testimony to the honors which he had received from him (Ann.,; His. ,). He had abundant means of knowing the facts which herecorded. Besides the extensive personal knowledge of which we have alreadyspoken, he had access to the public archives, to the records of the senate, tothe Acta Diurna or public journals of the city, to the Imperial Commentaries,to the histories of Coesar, Livy, Pliny the Elder, and many other documents orwriters, whom he consults as authorities, but whose statements he thoroughlysifts and seldom if ever adopts on mere trust. J In short, an air of sincerity,truthfulness and earnestness, a lofty appreciation of the purity and dignity of

history and a sacred scrupulousness to say nothing that shall in the least defileor degrade it, pervades all his historical writings. While therefore we admirethem as works of art arid study them as lessons of moral and political wisdom,we may also confide in them (with the necessary allowance for human in­firmity) as fountains of historical truti,, none the less true, but all the moreconvincing and persuasive, for the skill with which he arranges his facts, theearnestness with which he inculcates his sentiments and the eloquence withwhich they are adorned.



A glance at the principal events and leading characteristics of the period,which Tacitus has selected for his Histories, may afford an opportunity toobserve somewhat more particularly the writer's manner of treating his sub­ject, and may at the same time prepare the reader to follow him through thedetails with more intelligent interest. The first three emperors reigned in allonly about a year and a half, and all came to a violent death. Galba filledthe throne only seven months, Otho less than four, and Vitejus about eight,after which little and brief authority, they fell victims successively to thesame policy by which they had in succession risen to powerâ€”they took thesword, and they perished by the sword. Till the dethronement of Nero,the emperors had been nominally appointed by the senate, though the powerof the senate really extended no farther than to confirm the nomination of theirsuccessors by those who held the supreme authority. Now this nominal powerwas wrested from the senate and usurped by the troops. And since one armyhad as good a right as another to the honor and advantage of placing theircommander on the throne, there was a general rush for the city and the spoilsfrom every quarter of the empire. Galba was the first to disclose the secretthat an emperor could be nominated in a province as well as in the city, andinvested with the imperial purple by the military instead of the civil power(His. , ); and he was the first victim to this disastrous change in the policyof the state. He was named emperor by the legions under his own commandin Spain, and when their courage began to falter in so novel and hazardous anenterprise, he was raised to the throne by the Praetorian Guards in the capital,who were inflamed with resentment at the atrocious designs of Nero and fur­ther stimulated by the hope of an immense reward which had been promisedthem in the name, though without the authority, of Galba. But when theysaw that the donative was withheld, which could not be bestowed without arenewal of all the extortion and proscription of Nero himselfâ€”nay more, whenthey discovered that Galba would not indulge them in all the licentiousnessand crime in which they had revelled under Nero, the same Pnetorian Guardshurled him headlong from the throne, severed his head from his body, and lefthim weltering in hia gore. Galba had some apology for his ambition. Hisonly alternative was the scaffold or the throne. Happy for the reputation ofthe old soldierâ€”happy, we might almost say, for the old soldier himself, if hehad chosen the former. " He seemed too great for a private man while hewas one," says Tacitus, in one of those pregnant sentences of his which sooften body forth a whole character, ' as the cope of heaven is imaged in adewdrop,' " and the suffrages of all mankind would have pronounced himworthy of empire, had he never made the experimentâ€”omnium consensucapax imperii, nisi imperasset" (His. I, ).



Otho had no such excuse. He had been the first to espouse the cause ol

Galba, and he expected to hold the first place in his counsels. But he waÂ«disappointed, and he deserved to be. The old man nominated the virtuousPiso for his successor. And Otho avenged himself in the blood both of theaged emperor and his adopted son. It was Otho's highest recommendationto the degenerate Romans, that he resembled the corrupt and licentious Nero.The rabble, who now ruled at Rome, called him Nero Otho, and were readyat all hazards to follow his fortunes and to defend his throne. Galba hadfallen without a blow struck in his behalf. The cause of Otho was maintainedwith much spirit by followers like himself. In three considerable, though in­decisive, battles, his troops were victorious over those of Vitellius. In a fourth,they were defeated with great slaughter. Still they never wavered in then-attachment or faltered in hope. They urged and entreated him to summonall his forces and renew the fight. But he had resolved not to survive a defeat,tie plunged a dagger to his own heart, and terminated the life t" a debaucheeby the death, as it seemed to the Romans, of a philosopherâ€”as it appears tous, of a fool. The fortitude and composure, not without real or affected gen­erosity, which he displayed in his last hours, endeared him still more to hissoldiers, and many of them made a voluntary sacrifice of their lives at his fu­neral pile (His. , ).



Vitellius succeeded without further opposition to the vacant throne. Butlike his predecessors, he had scarcely marched his armies into Rome, beforehe was obliged to march them out again to meet a formidable competitor.Too lazy and stupid from the first to command his own forces, he had now be­come yet more drunken and debauched. Leaving all his military operationsto those generals whose energies alone had raised him to the throne, he gavehimself up to gluttony and intoxication. But one of them, Fabius Valens, hadbecome enervated and diseased by revelling. The other, Alienus Chechia,marches out at the head of the troops, but proves treacherous and makes anunsuccessful attempt to bring his soldiers over to the allegiance of Vespasian.On the other side, the main force had not yet arrived at the field of action fromSyria. Vespasian himself and Mucianus, his commander-in-chief, were stiDin the East. But the ardor and energy, the conduct and prowess of AntoniusPrimus, who happened to be located near the northern border of Italy, amplycompensated for deficiency of numbers, as the loyalty and zeal of Vitellius'army went far to counterbalance the treachery of one, and the absence of theother, of their generals. And the conflict which ensued, was protracted, fu­rious and sanguinary almost beyond a parallel even in the bloody annals ofcivil commotion. Fired not only by party passion, but by a thirst for bootyand blood, the followers of Antonius fought like tigers, nay like demons,through two days and the intervening night, defeated three successive armiesin three successive battles with little intermission, carried two distinct andstrongly fortified walls of defence about Cremona, plundered the treasures ofthat city, took captive its inhabitants and burned its edifices, public and pri­vate, sacred and profane, to the ground. The cause of Vitellius was nowruined. He himself had long given up in despair. In the language of Tacitus,he would have forgotten that he had ever been emperor, had not his followerspersisted in calling him such. They adhered to him with firmness and foughtfor him with desperation, when nothing remained to him but Rome and thedregs of its population. And in this last hopeless struggle the Capitol wÂ«a

burned and scenes of horror enacted, little less tragical than the sacking andconflagration of Cremona. Vitellius stalked about his palace, like a ghost, af­frighted by its emptiness and desolation, till weary of wandering he took refugeunder the bed in the porter's lodge. But he was soon discovered, draggedforth from his pudenda latebra, loaded with insults and put to death by re­peated wounds. In narrating these scenes of strife and horror, the historiancatches the inspiration of his subject, and, like the great epic poet of the Greeks',gathering strength and fervor as he proceeds, rises into unwonted and almostunrivalled eloquence. Witness the series of battles and assaults, which endin the destruction of Cremona by the troops of Antonius. No book of fictionwas ever more full of marvellous incidents; and no novelist or poet ever por­trayed them in livelier or stronger colors. The whole passage (His. , -)can hardly be matched for power in historical description, while for layingbare the workings of the human heart in excited and struggling masses of men,it stands, we believe, without a parallel in history.* See first, how he exposesto the reader's view the secret motives and sordid passions ot Antonius' men,when, after having defeated two distinct bodies of the enemy's troops, theycame in sight of Cremona (ch. ). Again, look at the lively and movingpicture of the calamities and crimes incident to civil war, which is groupedaround the lifeless body of a father slain unintentionally by the hand of hisown son in the th chapter. It is a truly Homeric episode, full of tendernessand pathos, relieving for the moment and yet enhancing in the end the im­pression made by protracted scenes of indiscriminate slaughter on the battle­field. Scarcely less Homeric is the description in the th chapter of a renew­ed and desperate assault upon the city, ending in those frightfully energeticwords: integri cum sauciis, semineces cum exspirantibus volvuntur, variapereuntium forma et omni imagine mortium. - Then to crown the whole,read the description of the sacking and conflagration of Cremona (ch. ),where " in so vast a multitude, as different in their language as their manners,composed of Roman citizens, allies and foreign auxiliaries, all the fell passionsof mankind were crowded togetherâ€”where nothing was unlawful, nothingsacred, since each soldiei had his peculiar notions of right and wrong, andwhat one scrupled another dared to execute." Yet even this is exceeded bythe mingled scorn and pity, bitter sarcasm and tragic pathos, with which ourauthor sets forth the shameful and shocking scenes of burning and pillage, ofrioting and revelling, which attended the close of Vitellius' disgraceful reign,in the midst of the imperial city, when " whatever the libidinous passions caninspire in the hour of peace was mixed with all the slaughter and horrors ofwarâ€”the whole city seemed to be inflamed with frantic rage, and at the sametime intoxicated with bacchanalian pleasuresâ€”a dreadful carnage was aspectacle added to the public gamesâ€” the populace enjoyed the havoc; theyexulted in the midst of devastation, and without any regard for either of thocontending parties, triumphed over the miseries of their country." Those,who cannot read the whole of the Histories, should by all means read the thirdBook. It is almost the only extant portion of the work, in which his descrip­tive powers have full scope. It well illustrates also the author's characteristicâ– kill in the delineation of character. Take, for instance, Vitellius, and, while

from stage to stage of his history you are made acquainted with his conduct,notice the lights and shades by which his character is brought out more andmore distinctly, till at length he stands before you, not so much a perfect pic­ture, as a living man, with not only his entire life but his whole heart nakedand open to your view. And do not fail to observe, how much of character isdeveloped often by a word or phrase. For example, in the last quotation: " adreadful carnage was a spectacle added to the public gamesâ€”the' populaceenjoyed the havoc," what an emphasis of meaning there is in the words initalics, and how they probe to the bottom the depths of corruption in thehearts of the city populace ! So when Vitellius was met and escorted into thecity by an infamous band of pimps, of charioteers, of players and buffoons,"all well known and dear to him by their utility in vicious pleasures," Tacitusadds: " such were tho disgraceful connections of the emperor, and he enjoyedthem without a blush."* How much of Vitellius is exhibited in this singlestroke ! This is characteristic of Tacitus. No writer ever conveyed so muchknowledge of things, and especially so much insight into men, in so few words.In like manner, the finisl,ing stroke in the portraiture of Galba (already men­tioned, p. ) brings out as it were the whole nature of the man with all itsgreatness and all its infirmities. So of Galba's adopted son, for whom he in­spires us with a just reverence and love in half a dozen words: quasi imperareposset, quam vellet. In like manner, he shows us the exact condition of theRoman state in half a sentence, when he makes Galba say to Piso: " you arecalled to rule over men who cannot endure either entire slavery or entire free­domâ€”jut nec lotam servitulem pati possunt, nee totam libertatem."



With tho accession of Vespasian to the throne, closes what is now extantof the Histories of Tacitus. We have not even the record of his arrival atRome. While he was proceeding deliberately through Egypt towards theimperial city, and busying himself partly in providing for the necessities ofthe city, partly in discovering his own future fortunes by the aid of thoEgyptian priests (His. , -fi), Mucianus exercised all the prerogatives ofsovereignty in his stead; Domitian aspiring to usurp power which did notbelong to him, and failing in the attempt, gave himself up to dissipation;and Titus, succeeding to his father's command in Judaea, was advancing tothe siege of Jerusalem (,-). Such is the posture of affairs, when the His­tories are brought suddenly to a close. The Jewish War is left incomplete.The fragment which remains is invested with peculiar interest to the Chris­tian, because it is so intimately connected at so many points with his holyreligion. Tacitus entertained many and violent prejudices against the Jews.It is not strange that he did. They were too exclusive in their politics andtoo intolerant in their religion, to be appreciated by any foreigners, most ofall by the liberal and polytheistic or free-thinking Romans. Accordinglythey received little mercy from Roman officers, and little sympathy fromRoman scholars. Despised as superstitious by the learned, and hated as sedi­tious by the great at Rome, it is not surprising that Tacitus should de­nounce them as a sordid, gloomy, unsocial and misanthropic race. It is infact but the very treatment they havo practically met with from the restof the world ever since. Not only prejudice against their singularities, but

PRELIMINARY REMARKS. 



ignorance of their real character and history, as a distinct and isolatedpeople, led him into many errors. Yet some rays of truth may be seengleaming through nearly all his mistakes, and confirmation of the sacredrecords may be gathered from all his apparent contradictions. The trueaccount of their origin is given in connection with several other traditionarytales (, ). The Exodus from Egypt, the journey through the wilderness,some of the miracles even of Moses are recorded (chap. ), not as they were,but as they would come to the ears and appear to the eye of a foreignerand a Roman. The rite of circumcision, the abstinence from swine's flesh,the use of unleavened bread, the observance of the seventh day as the sab­bath, and the seventh year as a year of restâ€”all these peculiar features ofthe Jewish religion are recognised, and referred to their supposed and some­times their real cause (chap. , ). Our author declares their belief in theimmortality of the soul and a future state of rewards and punishments, andgives a sublime description of the one God of the Jews, and the purelyspiritual worship which they paid to him (chap. ), so unlike at once to thepolytheism and the idolatry of all the rest of the world, and so unaccount­able, except on the supposition of special divine teaching. His geographyand topography of the country lead him to notice (chap. ) the plains ofSodom, the tradition touching the destruction of the once wealthy and popu­lous cities of the plain by fire from heaven, and the utter emptiness of thefruits of the earth in that region, so strikingly alluded to in sacred writ,and hence proverbial to this day, as the apples of Sodom and the clusters ofGomorrah.



But the Christian will regard with the greatest interest the confirmationwhich Tacitus unwittingly furnishes to the fulfilment of prophecy, in the ex­pected coming of the Messiah and in the circumstances attending the destruc­tion of Jerusalem. He informs us that the Jews cherished a lively expecta­tion, which was derived from prophecies contained in their sacred books, andwhich all their calamities could not extinguish, that at this very juncture thepower of the East would prevail over the nations, and a race of men would goforth from Judaea to extend their dominion over the rest of the world (,).Moreover he gives a graphic picture of those signs and wonders in the heavensabove and in the earth beneath, which our Lord predicted should attend thedestruction of Jerusalem and its holy temple (Matt. , Luke )â€”swordsgleaming in the air, embattled armies performing their evolutions in mid-heaven, strange sights and supernatural sounds in the temple, and the likeportentous omens of the approaching ruin of the city. It is not easy to say,whether Christianity is more illustrated and confirmed by this historical noticeof the general expectation of a mighty king and conqueror from the East,which had been nourished by ancient prophecies of the Messiah, or by theaccompanying record of the fulfilment of predictions uttered by the Messiahhimself touching the fate of his native land and its devoted metropolis. Itcannot but be regarded as truly remarkable, that two celebrated historians,the one a Jew and the other a pagan, both of whom rejected Christianity andhated the Christians, should have recorded so many facts which go directly toauthenticate and illustrate the Christian religion.



With the preparations for the siege of Jerusalem the thread of our Historiesis broken off. The description of the assault and capture is lost. Only the

preface, as it were, is preservedâ€”the principal part of the work, the history o:the Flavian Family, has perished. We cannot but mourn over the irreparableloss.* We feel, that we cannot afford to lose any thing from so instructiveand attractive a pen. Especially after wading through the chaotic and bloodyscenes in the reigns of Galba, Otho and Vitellius, we are unwilling to be de­nied the pleasure of reaching solid ground once more, and looking on thepeace, order and comparative happiness that spring up under the auspices ofVespasian and Titus, as they are painted by the same master hand. Thesiege of Jerusalem, with its amazing feats of valor and its more amazingscenes of calamity and sufferingâ€”what a subject for the pen of Tacitus! Wewould fain follow the beautiful and brilliant Titus through the glories of hismilitary triumphs to the brighter glories of his virtuous and happy, but tooshort reign. And we burn to see the fratricide and tyrant Domitian writhingunder the just vengeance of the prince at once of historians and of satirists.



Such a periodâ€”with such characteristics as our author briefly and vividlysketches in his introductory chapters (, . )â€”is not the most favorable to theexcitement of historical interest. The leading characters are for the mostpart both weak and wicked, at once odious and contemptible. And it is withextreme difficulty, that a history is made to sustain an interest, which doesnot attach to its leading characters. Still, as Tacitus intimates in the begin­ning of his third chapter, such a period is the very theatre for the display ofthe most heroic virtues in those private individuals who have the moral cour­age to breast the current of the times. And we shall find our historian's pagesadorned with biographical episodes and tributes of honor to many such noblesouls.



The great Halicarnassian critic would condemn Tacitus, as he did Thu-cydides (Dion. Halicarn. Epis. ad Cn. Pomp.), for selecting a period so fruit­ful in disasters and disgrace to his country. But the historian is not re­sponsible for the events which he records, any more than the messenger is forthe news he bears. He may be a truer patriot at heart and may render moreimportant services to his country, who sets up beacons at the points of herdanger, than l,e who rears monuments on the fields of her triumph. Thepatriotism of Herodotus and Livy exults in the glory of their country; that ofThucydides and Tacitus mourns over her shame. The muse of the former isfull of buoyancy and hopeâ€”she advances in the animated though stately airof a triumphal march, and ever and anon is heard singing paeans. The museof the latter is grave, thoughtful and melancholyâ€”she sits absorbed in sorrow­ful meditations and gloomy forebodingsâ€”or she moves- at a sad and solemnpace and utters " more hearselike harmonies than carols"â€”or now again, likeanother Cassandra, she starts up, as in a fit of prophetic phrensy, and poursforth wild and piercing cries of alarm. These warnings came too late for thesalvation of their countrymen: but the histories of the commotions and civilwars, which these great masters of their art have composed, are more in­structive to posterity, than all the foreign conquests and victories, whether ofGreece or Rome, which Herodotus and Livy have recorded. Inferior writers

PRELIMINARY REMARKS. 



may thrill their readers with a spirited detail of Roman triumphs; but it re­quired the genius of Tacitus to fathom the depths of Roman degeneracy andcorruption, and bring forth instruction and even delight from the shortlivedand ill-starred reigns of Galba, Otho and Vitellius. Tacitus himself felt deeplythe degradation of his country, and the consequent inferiority of his subject tothe more brilliant and imposing events of Rome's earlier history. " No manwill think of comparing these Annals," he says (Ann. , ), and the sameremarks are applicable for the most part to the subject-matter of the Historiesâ€”" No man will think of comparing these Annals with the historians of the oldrepublic. Those writers had for their subject wars of the greatest magnitude,cities taken by storm, kings overthrown and led into captivity; and whenfrom those scenes of splendor, they turned their attention to domestic occur­rences, they still had an ample field before them; they had dissensions be­tween the consuls and the tribunes; they had agrarian laws, the price of corn,and the plebeian and patrician orders inflamed with mutual animosity.Those were objects that filled the imagination of the reader and gave freescope to the genius of the writer. The work in which I am engaged, lies in anarrow compass; the labor is great, and glory there is none. A long andsettled calm, scarce lifted to a tempest; wars no soonar begun than ended; agloomy scene at home, and a prince without ambition or even a wish to en­large the boundaries of the empire: these are the scanty materials that liebefore me. And yet materials like these are not to be undervalued; thoughslight in appearance they still merit attention, since they are often the secretspring of the most important events."



Such is the modest estimate which Tacitus put upon his subject and histreatment of it. Posterity has judged more favorably of both. Lord Mon-boddo,* the severest of all the critics on his style, has well said: " His subject,I think, is grand and noble. It is the history of the fall of a great^people,greater than any that ever existed in arms and government, and in the extentand duration of their empire. Other nations may have been more glorious intheir'rise or in their prosperity, but none was ever so great in its fall; andthe period of Tacitus's history affords more extraordinary examples of virtuesand vices, sometimes mixed in the same man, than are to be found anywhereelse in the history of mankind. For the Romans are great in their vices aswell as their virtues, and in both almost exceed humanity. In treating thissubject, Tacitus never falls below the dignity of it, nor is it, I think, withoutreason, that he speaks himself of the gravity of his work. He shows him­self everywhere a lover of virtue anu of virtuous men, and expresses in thestrongest terms his detestation of cruelty and every kind of vice. He speakswith admiration of philosophy and its teachers, knowing that it was philoso­phy that had produced those extraordinary characters which he celebrates,such as that of Thrasea Partus and Helvidius Priscus."

the same time perceive that there may be great and good men even underbad princesâ€”where we behold fortune, fate and the gods themselves, in amanner wonderful and never sufficiently understood by mortals, direct thechangeful vicissitudes of human life, contemplating in the Annals the singu­lar fatality that followed the Julian family to its utter extinction, in the His­tories the convulsive energies that were put forth to re-establish a vacant andtottering sovereignty, do we not seem to ourselves to be reading some tragedyof /Eschylus, Sophocles or Euripidesâ€”does not the sorrowful image of Niobestand before our eyesâ€”are we not stricken through with a kind of horror, asif at the sight of Laocoon struggling in vain to disengage himself from thecrushing folds of the serpent ? Truly worthy of Tacitus, worthy also of themajesty of the Roman empire, is the design to explain with becoming wis­dom and diligence by what fate or fortune or succession of events ' jampridempraevalentis populi vires se ipsae confecerint*â€”what vices of the people ortheir rulers provoked the justice and the vengeance of the immortal gods, andprecipitated the fall of so vast an empire! So, like a second Scipio, we beholdTacitus sitting not now on the ruins of Carthage, but on the soil of Rome her­self, already tottering to her fall, and predicting with gushing tears the de­struction of his country, and that not in words of elaborate and far-fetchedstudy, but in such obvious and to him spontaneous forms of pathetic eloquence,as to present to the very eye the perfect image of that country* convulsed andtrembling on the verge of dissolution."



Livy is the only Latin historian who can at all contest the palm with Taci­tus. We need not attempt accurately to adjust the balance between them.It were no discredit to either of them to acknowledge the other to be hissuperior. Indeed their merits are so unlike that they can hardly be broughtinto direct comparison. There is no ratio between unlike quantities in mathe­matics ; neither can the terms greater and less be predicated in the gross ofdistinguished but diverse authors. In style, the pre-eminence must be con­ceded to Livy. His amazing versatility, his infinite variety always pleasesand never tires. Unpretending narrative and elaborate description, conciseannals and discursive eloquence, succeed and relieve each other with an in­exhaustible fertilityâ€”as the critics term it, with a lactea ubertas, both inthought and language, "always fresh, always sweet, always pure." Tacitus,it must be confessed, is wanting in variety and simplicity.t He does indeedvary his construction and forms of expression infinitely, as Boetticher andDoederleint have well illustrated. But he wants that higher variety andbeauty of historical composition, which results from telling a " fine storyfinely" and " a plain story plainly." He is always treading the stage in hishigh-heeled tragic buskins, and declaiming to a crowded amphitheatre at thetop of his voice. Doubtless his best passages far surpass any thing that can befound in Livy, for coloring and effect. But Livy on the whole is a morepleasing book to the reader, and a safer model for the young writer. Livy istho author to be read continuously; Tacitus, to be taken up at intervals. Theone furnishes a wholesome variety of food for the mind; the other serves hisreader too exclusively with strong meats and stimulating condiments.

PRELIMINARY REMARKS. 



For the sentiments and moral lessons which they convey, the meed of praisemust be divided between them. Both are fruitful in instruction. The moraltaste of both is pure and elevated. And yet they are very unlike: Livy's,sentiments appear to be drawn from books; Tacitus' are obviously the fruitof his own observation and meditation. Tacitus is original and just in hisreflections; Livy is varied and beautiful. Livy is the more genial spirit jTacitus, the more sagacious and profound.



In the delineation of character, Tacitus is greatly the superior. The char­acters of Livy want individuality. We are not made acquainted with theirdistinctive features. Still less do we see the very bottom of their hearts.In Tacitus every character stands out distinctly from the surrounding mass,wears his own face, and acts out his own peculiar motives and impulses.His heroes are as diverse as we know heroes are in nature; and in the wholeseries of tyrants and monsters, whose history he writes, the reader wouldno more confound their characters, than a contemporary and familiar ac­quaintance would have mistaken their persons. Tacitus draws characters asShakspeare does in his dramas; Livy paints them too much like the sophist inhis declamations. Livy places before us the statues of heroes and gods;Tacitus conducts us through the crowd of living men.



Livy is little more than an orator and scholar; Tacitus is also a statesmanand philosopher. Livy is the greater and better writer; Tacitus the greater andbetter man. We admire the former: the latter we reverence. Either mightinspire us with love; but Tacitus only can impress us with awe and fear.Tacitus selects his incidents with chief regard to their truth and intrinsicvalue; Livy, with a constant, not to say single, eye to their literary beautyand picturesque effect. Livy is wholly a Roman. To him, the Roman empireis the world. If he loved liberty, it was only Roman liberty. If he. extolledthe military skill and prowess of Hannibal, it was only that he might exaltRome herself, with her armies and commanders, to so much the higherglory, as their conquerors. Tacitus is a man and reverences the manly vir­tues, wherever he finds them. The best speech he ever wrote is put intothe mouth of a free and noble Briton. He half prefers the simple virtues ofthe barbarous but free and independent Germans, to the splendid vices ofthe cultivated but degenerate Romans. To him Arminius is none the lessa hero for being a German; and he complains (Ann. , ), that the Greeksembellished nothing but their own story, while the Romans, absorbed in theveneration of antiquity, did injustice alike to all contemporary achievements.In a word, Livy was born to compose the history of the rise and gioryof the Roman empire; Tacitus of its decline and fall. It was the voeationof Livy to compose a great prose epic in honor of his country. It was themission of Tacitus to write a magnificent historical tragedy for the instruc­tion and warning of mankind.

BOOK I.



 ChiP. I It has been conjectured, that this Book, as it now stands



is acephalous, the words Populi Romani res enarraturo, or the like,having been lost from the beginning. But the subject of the work issufficiently brought out in what follows, and was doubtless prefixedalso in a title. Initium is pred. after erunt.



LinE . Ser. Gaiba ... consules â€” annus, in quo fuere consules,i. e., the st of January, a. u. c. , A. D. . The reign of Galba hadcommenced in June of the previous year. As Galba was put to deathon the th of January (cf. chap. , seq.), only half a month of hisreign is directly embraced within the compass of the Histories of ourauthor,-who having for his main object to write the history of theFlavian dynasty, commences with the beginning of the civil year,which was nearly coincident with those commotions in the armiesof Germany, which led to the assumption of imperial power by Ves­pasian. The chronology may be seen at a glance in the table onp. .â€”Consules means colleagues (those who go together, con andsul, root of salio) or joint presidents of the Roman republic. Cf.Smith's Diet, of Gr. and Rom. Ant., sub voc, and Niebuhr's History,as there cited.



. Post conditam urbem. Observe the concrete form of expres­sion. The Latin language is very deficient in such abstract words asfoundation, constitution, &c. The people were marked for action,and their language deals in facts.â€”Octingentos. Al. septingentos.But the number of years here mentioned, must cover the whole periodfrom the founding of the city to the second consulship of Galba(otherwise the clause, though beginning with nam, assigns no reasonfor commencing the history with that date), and that was  years(in round numbers, exactly ). Cf. , : per octingentos vigintiannos. Septingentos is a conjectural reading.



. Dam.... memorabantur. So long as the history of theRoman people (i. e. the republic) was being written. For after thebattle of Actium, it was tes Caesarum, not res populi Romani, thatwere recorded. So in Ann. ,, Pop. Rom. prospera vel adversa isopposed to temporibus Augusti. Cf. also G. , Pop. Rom. vs. Caesari.



. Eloquentia ac libertate. These words limit retulerunt.â€”Libertate: postquam. Al. libertate. Postquam. But postquam ...bellatum, etc., is antithetic to dum res, etc. (the antithetic particleted being omitted. Cf. Essay on the Style of T, p. ); and there­

fore should not stand at the beginning of a new sentence. The whole gjpassage thus re^d and pointed may be summed up as follows:â€”. He states the date with which he intends to begin his history, viz.the second consulship of Galba = a. u. c. . . He gives thereason why he does not commence at an earlier date, viz. that manyhave written the history of the whole period prior to that date.. But he subdivides that whole period into two parts, viz. the Repub­lic and the Empire, the former of which has boen treated with asmuch freedom as eloquence, but not so the latter. Tacitus may havealready had in mind the plan, which he afterwards executed (in hisAnnals), of writing also the history of the latter period, because,though written by many, it had been treated without ability orimpartiality. Cf. Ann. , , a passage which sheds much light on this.



. Actium. Where Augustus defeated Antony and establishedhimself in the sole possession of the supreme power.â€”Potentiam. ALpotestatem. Potestas est i^ovota, potentia vafus. So Wr.,* who argues,that not omnis potestas, all lawful authority, but omnis potentia, allpower and might was concentred in one man, that he might preservepeace. For this distinction, cf. His. , ; Ann. , ; Cic. prodomo, . See also Or. in loc.



. Conferri = brought together, united in one man.



Â« Siruul veritas, etc. See a similar passage in Dion, , .



. Ut alienae. Since it was the property of another, i. e. theemperor, not the people. So Wr., Or. and Dod. As if it were a for­eign state; for they had no more to do with it, and therefore caredand knew no more about it, than if it were a foreign republic. SoErnesti. A truly republican sentiment, according to either interpre­tation. The former is preferable.â€”Rursus. Cf. note A. .



. Iufensos. Sc. principibus.



. Ambltionem. Lit., going about to solicit favor. Henceflattery to the great, explained below by adulationi.



. Adverseris. So the MSS., Wr. and Dod. Al. averseris,Rup., Or. But without good authority or reason. For the accusativeafter adversor, cf. Gr. , R. ; Z. . Also Freund's Lexicon,sub voce. For the subjunctive here, cf. Gr. , II.; Z. . Youmay easily withstand or resist. Wr. refers it to the writer: You(any writer) may easily withstand the temptation to flatter. This ismoro pertinent to the connection. But scriptoris suggests rather theidea, that the reader can easily withstand, etc. So Rup. and mostothers.â€”Pronis auribus, literally, ears inclining or bending forward= willing ears.

r. Supremae .... necessitates. Illustrious men were re­duced to the last necessities, such as precede and threaten death orrender it unavoidable, but not (as many suppose) death itself; forthey are here distinguished from exitus, and, as used elsewhere, thewords denote, not death, but the prior necessity, whether imposed by-popular indignation, as in the case of Tigellinus, , , or the loss ofimperial favor through calumny, as in the case of Messaiina, Ann., (where pi. as here: supremis necessitatibus), or the direct com­mand of the emperor, as in tho case of Seneca, Ann. , . Cf. alsonecessitate, His. , . This clause was probably meant to state onlya general fact, introductory to the virtues specified in the next twoclauses; though, as Wr. suggests, the bare'existence of such necessi­ties, when they might have been escaped by obsequious compliancewith the tyrant's wishes, was no small proof of virtue. The wordnecessitas properly denotes, that which is unavoidable (ne-cessum,from cedo. Cf. Freund, sub v.).

and Ruperti, propose to expunge rt at ouce, as a mere gloss. Andgcjthey have good reason to be dissatisfied with most of the comments,for, almost without exception, they either sacrifice the force of ipsa, ormake necessitas something quite different from necessitates, which,though maintained by Dod., is not borne out by the usage of Tacitus,and can hardly be supposed in such a juxtaposition as this. But doesnot the following interpretation avoid both these objections and meetall the demands of the passage ? Illustrious men were reduced tothe last necessities (involving or threatening death); the necessityitself was endured with fortitude, and the deaths (which ensued)were equal to the glorious deaths of the ancients. Ipsa thus marksthe antith. between necessitas and exitus; while necessitas is distin­guished from exitus and identified with necessitates, as it manifestlyshould be.

. Dono .... civitatis. Claudius had conferred the gift ofRoman citizenship upon the Gallic chiefs (Ann. , ), but Galbagave it to all who had taken part with Vindex.

This victory was of course a source of pride ; but it wasalso a ground of vexation (irati), anxiety (solliciti) and fear (metu),because though a real service to the Â«tate for which they deservedreward, it was rendered to Nero, and was more likely to be punishedthan rewarded by Galba.

Al. pointed and read thus: multi vo-luntate  effusius qui noluerant; medii, ac plurimi, obvio obsequio.But medii is a conjectural reading; and this punctuation destroys theproper antithesis, which is usually the best clue to the understandingof Tacitus: many out of cordial good-will expressed their approbation(favebant understood) freely and fully ; those who were opposed (to thenomination), in moderate (ordinary, commonplace) tert^; and a stillgreater number (the major part) with ready complaisance, cherishinghopes of personal advantage (from Piso's elevation) without regardto the public welfare.

Doderlein says: in itinere,dum iter faciunt; in agmine, dam ambulant, exercendi causa. Orelli-has still another way of distinguishing the phrases.

The distinc­tion is the same which always prevails between the imperf. and theperf. in the indie.; but which is not usually observed in the subj,where the tenses are less distinctly marked in all languages, and wherein Latin the perf. is generally used only as a perf. definite, and theimperf. is used indiscriminately for completed and incomplete actions.The rule for the succession of the tenses would require the imperf.tubj. in both places here.

 NOTES.



as also that of the corresponding word vexillarii, has been much dis­puted, seems to have denoted, . The standard of the cavalry (assignum was the standard of the smaller divisions of the infantry, andaquila of the whole legion). . The standard of a detachment oftroops, drafted and dispatched for a specific purpose. . The standardof a body of GOO veterans, attached (but not belonging) to each legion,released from the military oath and free from ordinary duty, but re­tained sub vexillo to render their assistance in the more severe battles,hence technically called vexillarii. In each of these three senses, thevexillum often stands for the troops that served under it. Here theword is used in the second sense = the German vexillarii. Cf. ,where these same troops are called numeri e Germania, and are saidto have been electos praemissosque ad bellum in Albanos. For a fulldiscussion of this subject, see Ruperti's note on vexilla, A. . Seealso Smith's Diet, of Antiq., on Roman Army.

Administer theoath, lit. go over it before them, as they pour in successively. Theofficer pronounced the words of the military oath, and lie soldier re­peated the words after him. Hence the former was said praeire sa­cramentum, and the latter jurare in verba ejus. In a regular ad­ministration of the oath, only one of the soldiers repeated the words,and the others swore to the same that he had done before them. Inthe present instance, the soldiers expressed their zeal by volunteeringto administer it to each other. Observe the asyndeton and the seriesof infinitives, indicative of rapidity.

ggCelsus a fear as to the sincerity of the reconciliation, he treated himat once as a most intimate friend, i. e. as if there were no need ofreconciliation. This is substantially Ritter's view of this much disputedpassage. Dod. follows the same reading and gives essentially thesame interpretation, but thinks the text requires some amendment.Other readings and other interpretations have been suggested too nu­merous to mention. But none of them give so good a sense as this,and none rest on much, if any, better authority of MSS. The readingof Wr., Rup. and Or., with several of the best MSS., is this: sed, nehostes metueret, conciliationes adhibens.

Anglice: treason, though majeslas is morecomprehensive than treason. Cf. Smith's Die. of Antiq.; also Man.as above. To pardon the crime of majestas was now popular; topardon repetundae was unpopular.

Doderlein takes it as a request tobe discharged, which derives some support from the abjectie .... in-signibus, as well as from the frequent use of otium by T. as the oppo­site of war. Cf. note, A. . But the use of salutem rather favorsthe interpretation of Brotier and Rup. They demanded safety fortheir persons, and order, tranquillity, in the camp. Otherwise (asthey intimated by casting off their badges) they could not retain theiroffices.â€”Sensit invidiam. Felt the odium, or reproach, thus broughtupon themselves.

. Depoposcerint. Cf. : crediderim; : obstiterit. Thisuse of the subj. is much more frequent in the later than in the earlierLatin. "Theperf. subj., when used independently, usually has themeaning of a softened future." Z. . Zumpt suggests, by way ofexplaining this meaning, that the same form is probably used both forthe subj. perf. and the subj. of the fut. perf., e. g. depoposcerim â€”subj. both of depoposci and depoposcero. It does not necessarily im­ply doubt. Cf. Cic. Brut. : Hoc sine ulla dubitatione confirmaverim,etc. In such questions as this it implies a negative answer. Cf. note,: mererelur. The use of the perf. subj. after ut and ne (as in utquesic dixerim, G. ) is entirely peculiar to the silver age.



T. Praestriiigimus = obumbramus. Al. perstringimus, whichis the reading of the MSS., and is retained by Rup. in the sense ofhebetamus. The departure from the MSS. is justified by Wr., fromthe frequent and easy confounding of those two syllables.â€”Nationes,imaginem .... exercitus, senatus. Notice the position of these em­phatic words in their respective clauses.



> . Constiterint. Subj. as usual after the impers. verb. Cf. Gr.', R. .

MSS. Al. strepitus telorum et fades belli erat militibus, which isadopted in the common editions with a colon after erat. Various oth­er emendations have been suggested. But it may be read as it is,and the conciseness and enallage of the text go to substantiate its gen­uineness. Strepitus .... belli is one reason for non quies redierat ;et militibus, etc., is another. The former is expressed in the nom.,the latter is thiPl-egular abl. of cause.

The city of Rome, andother towns within its dominion, always underwent a lustratio afterthey had been visited by some great calamity, such as civil bloodshed,awful prodigies and the like.

Reipublicae cannot be dat. afterpertinuere, which always takes ad or in with the acc. after it. Hencesome read in rempublicam ; others expunge reipublicae, though foundin all the MSS. Pertimuere is found instead of pertinuere in severalMSS., but not the best. Pertinuere = duravere according to Wr.But why not take it in the more usual sense of reached, belonged to,or affected, sc. the people ? Tacitus' use of pertinere may be seen in, : Expugnatae urbis praedam ad militem, deditae ad duces, per­tinere. Dod. makes reipublicae dat. (for acc. with ad) after perti­nuere.

 NOTES.



Plgl



â€”Hint majores, etc. The sense of this concise passage is very weBexpressed by Murphy thus : hence the shadows of men and horsesprojected forward to such a length, that the Vitellians, deceived byappearances, aimed at a wrong mark. Their darts by consequencefell short of their aim. The moonbeams, in the mean time, playedon the front of their lines and gave their bodies in full view to theadverse army, who fought behind their shadows as if concealed inobscurity.

This little incident, like some of Homer's episodes, is exceedinglytouching, and conveys a more affecting sense of the evils of civil war,than even the author's matchless description of the blood and carnageof the battle-field. The concluding clause (factum esse .... faciunt-que) is cited by Monboddo (On Lang. , , ) as an example ofaffected smartness in the turn of expression; but it brings out in avery striking light a singular trait in depraved human nature: theytalk of the wicked deed that has just been done, and still go on todo it.



Ch. XXVI.â€”. Munire castra. Followed by a mark of inter-Jgrogation in the common editions, at the suggestion of Ernesti. Butthis is unnecessary. The sentence begins just like the one above: in-cipere, etc. The only difference between the two is, that here idquoque is thrown in by apposition with munire to indicate deliberation.Wr. makes munire depend on si juberent implied in quid juberentabove.

This portion of the history furnishes a very good illustration of ourauthor's characteristic power of description. The rapid succession ofbloody battles and sieges, in which Antonius and his followers foughtlike tigers, nay like demons, through two days and the interveningnight, defeated three separate armies in three successive encounterswithout intermission, and carried two distinct and strongly fortifiedlines of defenceâ€”walls, towers and bulwarksâ€”around Cremona, issketched with a rapidity and force fully adequate to the subject. Theoutward movements and the inward motives of tho men are set beforethe eye of the reader with equal distinctness. And finally the burningand sacking of the city presents a picture of unrestrained passions, ofunbounded crimes, of dreadful calamities and sufferings, of utter deso*lation and ruin, to which history and even the drama with all its wildlicense of imagined horrors can furnish few parallels. The student,who has failed to perceive the historian's power, has read" the passageto little purpose, and will do well to read it again. In default of allother means of appreciating it, he will find the passage well represent­ed in Murphy's translation, though not with all the conciseness, forceand fire of the original. Cf.

T. is charged by many with error here, or at leastwith speaking rhetorically, rather than what was historically true.

Voltaire pronounces these the best au­thenticated miracles that are to be found in history, sacred or profane.Hume also adduces them with great confidence, as an offset againstthe Christian miracles. But look at the circumstances above advertedto,â€”the discrepancy in the written recordsâ€”the conspiring interest ofthe emperor, the priests and the physicians to get up a miracleâ€”thereadiness of the people to believe itâ€”and the motive of the originalwitnesses in the first place to tell the story, and then to persist in it.Moreover, the cases are expressly declared to have been such in theiroutward appearance, that a deception might easily have been practised.The language of T. (dedita superstitionibus gens, etc.) makes it morethan doubtful whether he believed in any miracle, though he leaves noroom to doubt some of the facts.

It cannot but strike us, familiar as we are with the origin and his.tory of the Jews, as very singular that Tacitus should have contentedhimself with throwing together such a crude jumble cf contradictoryfables, instead of going to the original records, or consulting Jewishauthorities, in all of which he would have found the same consistentand true story. But it is important for us to bear in mind, in readingthis or any other Roman history of the Jews, that they were a so-cluded and peculiar people ; that their neighbors consequently knewlittle of them, and were prejudiced against them ; and that at Romoespecially, they were hated by the great for their insubordination, anddespised by the learned for their superstition, bigotry and intolerance.It should also be remembered, that the same prejudice extended to theearly Christians, who were regarded as a Jewish sect, and are oftenspoken of by Roman writers in the same terms of hatred and con­tempt as the Jews. See the famous passage in the Annals (, ),where T. calls Christianity an exitiabilis superstitio. Yet on boththese subjects we find traces of the truth in nearly all our author'serrors, and those errors need not destroy our confidence in his veracityas a historian, on subjects about which he was bettor informed andless prejudiced.

. Nam... . desciverat. This passage involves so serious achronological difficulty, that the commentators resort to emendationsof the text to effect a solution. Arsaces, the founder of the Parthianftiate, revolted from Antiochus II. almost a century before the war oJAntiochus Epiphanes with the Jews. Wr., Or. and Dod. suppose thatT. confounded the two Antiochi, and thus fell into an anachronism.Ernesti regards the passage as an interpolation. Brotier and Rup.suggest emendations. The Bipontines understand by Arsaces, one ofthe successors of Arsaces I., for it became the family name. Cf. note,, : Arsacidarum. This will remove the difficulty, if we may alsotake desciverat in a sense applicable, not to the original revolt, but tothe continued rebellion aud war; for that Antiochus Epiphanes wa*engaged in a war with the Parthians appears from the first and secondBooks of the Maccabees, where, as in the poets, they are called Persians.

Kingly power, however, corruptedthe truly virtuous and heroic character which originally belonged tothe family, and they became for the most part monsters in crime andcruelty, and reigued only amid commotions till the Romans extendedtheir conquests over Judeea.

. Fous perennis. Jerusalem has always been found to possessan inexhaustible supply of water for the most protracted siege, evenwhen the besieging armies, as for instance that of the crusaders, havesuffered intolerably from thirst. A mystery still overhangs the sourceof this supply. Large cisterns are known to exist. But "there isalso good ground to believe, that there has also been from very ancienttimes an unfailing source of water derived by secret and subterraneanchannels from springs to the west of the town, and communicating byother subterraneous passages with the pool of Siloam and the fountainof the Virgin in the east of the town."

Im­mense cisterns of great antiquity still exist within the area of the tem­ple, supplied partly by rain-water and partly by an aqueduct fromSolomon's pools, and which of themselves would furnish a tolerablesupply in case of a siege.

 Exapertae... fores. These doors or gates were of brass, andcould scarcely be opened by twenty men. Cf. Joseph. B. J. , , .Exapertae is found in no other classic writer. It appears in Jerome'sconfessions.



. Delubri. Probably from de and luo = the place of expiation-Freund.â€”Excedere deos. That the gods (the guardian divinities ofthe temple) were departing. Compare with this the Roman customof evoking the gods from the cities which they besieged. Plin-, .



. In metum trahebant.' Construed as a ground of fear- i. e.as ominous of evil. So Ann. , : ad metum trahebant. Trahere isused in the same sense in , .



. Antiquis .... Uteris, i. e. the books of the prophets, whichare full of prophecies of the Messiah, and some of which, e. g. Daniel,fix with great defiuiteness the time of his coming (eo ipso tempore).The Jews understood these to promise a temporal deliverer and con­queror. Hence the universal expectation, that at this very time theEast should become powerful, and persons proceeding from Judaashould become masters of the world. Languago happily descriptiveof the spiritual conquests of Christ and his apostles! Josephus andSuetonius use very similar language. B. J. G, , ; Suet. Vesp. .



T. Q,uae ambages .... praedixerat. Which oracle was to beaccomplished in Vespasian and Titus, who had command in theEast, and thence marched to the sovereignty of Rome. Such an in­terpretation would bo easily adopted by a Roman historian, especiallyone who had received favors from the Flavian dynasty (cf. , ). Itis even countenanced by Josephus, in compliment doubtless to thesame princes. B. J. , , . Al. praedixerant. Ambages is used byother writers only in the pl. and the abl. sing. Cf. Ann. , .

her connection!, who served as internuntii numinis. Cf. , : de-Uctu$ e propinquis.



. Caesos Trcveros. Cf. , . .â€”Receplos Ubios. TheUbii had been received back, i. e. had submitted and returned to theirformer friendly relation to the Romans.



. Exsulem...et extorrem. An exile and an outcast. Thesewords have a similar etymology (extorris from ex-terra, exsul fromex-solum) and do not differ essentially in meaning. They are usedtogether by T. for emphasis, and with his usual fondness for pairs ofkindred words. Exsul denotes more frequently a legal banishment;extorris a forcible expulsion.



. Inde. On their side. Hinc. On his side, sc. that of Cerialia.Observe the pairs of substantives in these two clauses. The sense maybe expressed by hendiadys thus: the guilt of injustice ... the revengeof the gods ; though the connection in which they are placed by theauthor, is more lively and energetic.



Ch. XXV.â€”. Q,uid profectum. Al. perfectum. Cf. A. ;nihil prqfici ; A. : parum profid, etc.



. Armis for ad arma. So T. often ; earlier writers seldom. Cf.Essay, pp. . .

. Germanorum feminas. Such as Veleda, who were virtuallytheir sovereigns, though not formally; for a female sovereign was forthe most part deemed a disgrace by the Germans. Cf. G.  and .



. Atrociora. Al. atrociore with rabie in the next clause. Butthen the comparative has no force.



 *-"n- XXVI.â€”. Nabaliae. This name occurs nowhere else, andit seems impossible to determine what river is meant. Brotier refersit to the channel made by Drusus from the Rhine to the Yssel, Walc-kenaer to the Yssel itself, etc. Cf. Ann. , .â€”Abrupta. Extremi­ties, where the bridge was brolcen off.



. Defenderer. Notice the middle sense.



. Debebatur. Imp. ind. for ,mp. subj. Cf. Gr. , R. ; Z., b.



. Inimica, hosttlia. Inimicus, qui nos odit, hostilis qui oppug-nat. Facciolati and Forcellini's Lexicon.

The concluding sentence is incomplete. The much vaunted Gallicempire soon came to an end. The subsequent fortunes of Civilis arenot known. But from the offers made him (cf. chap. ), it is inferredthat he received a full pardon.
